It's been a number of years since I'd taken my last `swimming lesson <{filename}/20151025-learning-to-swim-as-an-adult-i-learning-to-not-drown.rst>`__.
That was back in 2015, when I was still working on my PhD at university.

A lot has happened since then.
We lost a few years locked in.
Few were lucky to get out unaffected, if any at all.
Now, it's 2024.
I'm older, finally earned my PhD, have been working for a number of years already too.
A lot has changed.

Somehow, all these years, I didn't get a chance to continue my swimming lessons.
Something or the other always took priority.
Also, even though I could sort of do a length of the pool when assisted by a float at the end of the last set of lessons, we didn't get to the point of learning how to breathe and so on.
So, I haven't been comfortable enough to go to a public pool with other swimmers to practice.
I needed someone looking after me.
I need a protected space.

Finally, after eight years, I've gone back to adult swimming lessons.
I was lucky last time because the university swimming folks had organised lessons for adults back then.
This time, I had to go looking around London.
It wasn't as easy to find lessons as I'd thought it'd be.
I mean there are a lot of lessons around, but a lot of these seem to be one-on-one lessons that cost quite a bit.
I can't afford swimming lessons at 60Â£/hour.
Time is also much scarcer now that I'm working full time.

I eventually group found lessons that fit my requirements at the `London Aquatics Centre <https://www.londonaquaticscentre.org/about>`__.
The groups aren't too large.
In the two lessons that I've done so far, we've been five or six people with plenty of space in the practice pool (1.2m depth of water).
They do regular lessons throughout the week either late in the evenings, or early in the mornings.
Early morning lessons do mean waking up even earlier than normal and driving half an hour to the pool, but I tend to prefer mornings for this sort of activity, when I'm fresh and energetic.
There's also lesser traffic in the mornings.


The first class (again)
=======================

The first few minutes were quite nervy.
I knew I couldn't have expected to just continue where I'd left off, but I hadn't thought I'd have become nervous in the water again.
The others in the lesson were also further on.
They could swim with supports, some even without.
They were doing lengths and learning how to breathe.

That day, I was the only one that was an absolute beginner.
So, while others were doing their thing, I was by myself in the side of the pool where I could practice my kicking.
Learning alone is less fun, and there were times when I felt the instructor was paying more attention to the advanced students.
But, that's fair enough.
We'd all paid the same amount, after all.
Anyway, important things to remember about kicking:

- one should try to kick from the hip
- legs should be straight at the knee
- toes should point out

That doesn't mean that the legs should be stiff, though.
Relaxed, but straight.

Initially, I wasn't comfortable enough to let go of the side of the pool.
I could kick fine with my head in the water, but I wasn't letting myself relax enough to feel the force of the water keeping me afloat.
The moment I'd let go of the pool's side, I'd immediately panic and stand up, or grab on to the side of the pool again.

This was a problem, because one cannot really swim if they're not relaxed in the water.
My "swim doctor" told me so.
I was rigid, and I was trying to use the side of the pool to keep me afloat.
So we tried something else, a different tact---the mushroom float.
The idea of a mushroom float is that one takes a deep breath, then bends their knees to tuck them under their chin, while bringing their arms around their knees to keep them close.
This submerges the person in the water, and then the upthrust will make them float.

OK, I understood the logic and the physics there.
Doing it is a whole different scenario though.

The first time I did it, as soon as the water made me float and my feet stopped touching the pool floor, I panicked.
Immediately, my feet came down again.
I tried it a few times but I couldn't overcome the panic.
It was good that I was floating, but I had no control, and that caused the panic.

So I broke it down into steps.
I kept my arms tight around my knees to stop my legs from going back down to begin with, but then let one leg go down for a start.
This made me feel the upthrust.
It made me realise that *I will really float*.
After a few tries I was able to keep both feet tucked in and float freely.
It wasn't perfect the first few times either.
Even though I was floating, I was very tense.
I had to fight my will to not put my feet back down.
I was holding on with my arms quite tightly.
After a few tense tries, once I'd spent enough time floating, I managed to relax my body and just bobble at the surface of the pool.

The trick here also is to get it once, and then practice again and again to consolidate the memory.
Once I had it, I kept doing it again and again until I was very comfortable doing a mushroom float, further and further away from the sides of the pool.
This helped me build confidence that I can stay away from the sides of the pool and not drown.
If anything happened, all I had to do was go into a mushroom float.

The instructor did ask us to try doing lengths, but I wasn't ready.
I thought the mushroom float was great progress, though.
It made me comfortable in the water.
The first lesson ended at this point.

The second lesson
=================

In the second lesson, our instructor asked us to do more floats.
They were happy with my mushroom float, and suggested I try the star float next.
I did the mushroom float a few times to remind myself of the relaxed floating feeling I'd learned in the previous lesson.

Doing the star float on my front wasn't a problem.
After doing the mushroom float and realising that there is enough upthrust to keep me afloat, I could also lie on my front and relax.
The issue there of course is that my head is in the water, so I can't breath.

I haven't yet been able to do the star float on my back though.
It's all about positioning again, and I haven't reached a stage where I can bring my legs and hips high enough to get the upthrust I need.
While I do float a little I'm not horizontal enough.
My hips and legs are below my head, and slowly but surely start to drop.

I tried that unsuccessfully a number of times before we did a few lengths with floats.
I was able to do them fine on my front again, but because I haven't learned how to bring my head up to breathe yet, I must stop each time I run out of air.
After the trainer left and we didn't have floats, I also practised doing lengths on my front without floats.
That is fine too.


This is where I'll pick up from at the next lesson.
I need to bring my head up to breathe, to allow me to do a full length without stopping.
And, I really want to figure out the back star float, because it's a really fun and efficient way of staying afloat.
The trick there is to relax, to lie down and let go.
I panic, like I did when I was doing the mushroom float initially, so it's about overcoming that response.

Let's see how it goes.

Conclusion
==========

It's all about being relaxed.
This is what makes it hard because the normal bodily reaction is completely the opposite---one of panic!

I do understand why people say it's easier to learn as a child.
A child, somehow, probably because one isn't aware of drowning, doesn't have the same fear of water---maybe one hasn't learned the panic responses yet.
However, as an adult, I think there's also the advantage of being able to break it down and really understand what needs to be done.
The panic response is certainly there, but it isn't one that cannot be overcome.

It's all about getting it the one time.
Once it's clicked, my feelings swing from fear to excitement---because now one knows it can be done, one just has to reproduce what they did before.

Let's see how it goes.
I've already made progress, so I'm confident that with regular lessons I'll finally learn how to properly swim this time.
Once I can swim a little, I'll also join the local pool to spend more time in the water to practice more.
The graph is certainly going in the right direction.


If you're like me, an adult who can not swim, know that it is very doable.
Where I'd be nervous before, I now enjoy my time at the pool.
It's also such great exercise.
So, think about it.
It doesn't sound easy, and because of our panic responses, it isn't sometimes, but it's definitely something that can still be learned.
