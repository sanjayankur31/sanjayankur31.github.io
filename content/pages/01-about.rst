    I'm Ankur (pronounced :code:`'ǝŋkur 'sInhɑ:`, and written :code:`अँकुर िसनहा` in Hindi).

By profession, I am a computational neuroscientist. I am also a `Free Software enthusiast`_ and believe in openness---`in software`_ and `in science`_.
I am interested in various areas of neuroscience---structural, synaptic, homeostatic plasticity; cortical and cerebellar processing; tools and infrastructure for neural modelling at various levels of detail and standardisation of computational models, and also the plethora of tools for data analysis.

I prefer Python to Matlab, and `Open source software to proprietary tools <http://opensourceforneuroscience.org/>`__.

I can be reached at :code:`ankursinha AT fedoraproject DOT org` or via one of the various social media platforms linked to in the right hand side bar.

If you need to send me encrypted e-mail or verify my signed commits, my public GPG key is below:

Profile
~~~~~~~~

Research Fellow at the Silver Lab at UCL
==========================================

(March 2020 - )

I am currently a research fellow at the `Silver Lab <https://silverlab.org>`__ at `University College London <https://ucl.ac.uk>`__.
Apart from the research projects that are ongoing at the research group, I also focus on the development of the `Open Source Brain <https://opensourcebrain.org>`__ platform, `NeuroML <https://docs.neuroml.org>`__ and associated technologies.


Visiting Lecturer at the University of Hertfordshire
====================================================

(2014 - 2020)

I was a visiting lecturer at the School of Engineering, Computer Science, Physics, Astronomy, and Mathematics at UH.
I taught on modules related to computing, and supervised undergraduate and post-graduate projects.

Education
~~~~~~~~~~

Ph.D. in Computational Neuroscience: UH Biocomputation
=======================================================

(2014 - 2020)

I earned my Ph.D. in Computational Neuroscience at the `Biocomputation group <http://biocomputation.herts.ac.uk>`__ at the `University of Hertfordshire <http://www.herts.ac.uk/>`__.

| Primary supervisor: `Professor Volker Steuber`_
| Secondary supervisors: `Dr Christoph Metzner`_, `Professor Rod Adams`_, `Dr Neil Davey`_, `Professor Michael Schmuker`_.
|

Thesis: Structural Plasticity and Associative Memory in Balanced Neural Networks With Spike-Time Dependent Inhibitory Plasticity.

Masters by Research: UTS, Sydney
=================================

(2012 - 2014)

I completed my ME (by research) at the `University of Technology, Sydney <http://www.uts.edu.au/>`__. I studied and modelled neuron sets that are related to navigation in the mammalian brain using the `ROS robotic framework <http://www.ros.org/>`__. I worked on head direction cells, place cells, grid cells, and boundary cells.

Supervisor: `Dr Jack Wang`_

Thesis: `Bio inspired navigation in a mobile dynamic environment`_
