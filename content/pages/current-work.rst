I am a post-doctoral Research Fellow at the `Silver Lab <https://silverlab.org>`__ at `University College London <https://ucl.ac.uk>`__ working on computational modelling projects.
My work focuses on building tools and standards for biophysically detailed computational modelling in neuroscience and am actively involved in several open source communities.

Research & development
-----------------------

Investigation of cortico-cerebellar loops
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

https://github.com/sanjayankur31/GolgiCellNetwork

This involves developing biophysically detailed models of components of the cortico-cerebellar loop to investigate their functions and mechanisms.

- **Status**: active development
- **Tools**: NeuroML, Python, NEURON, NetPyNE

-----

Standardisation of Human L2/3 cortical model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

https://github.com/sanjayankur31/Human-L2-3-Cortical-Microcircuit

- **Status**: model conversion complete, network validation in progress
- **Tools/technologies**: NeuroML, Python, NetPyNE

This involves standardising the published Human L2-3 cortical microcircuit model to NeuroML_ for community use:

- ion channels
- neuronal morphologies
- synaptic mechanisms

NeuroML
~~~~~~~~

**2020** **-**

https://docs.neuroml.org, https://github.com/NeuroML

NeuroML is an international, collaborative initiative that maintains an ecosystem of tools for biophysically detailed/realistic neuronal modelling.
The ecosystem consists of:

- a simulator independent specification (standard)
- core tools for reading/writing NeuroML (APIs), and running simulations using different simulation engines
- an extended ecosystem of software tools that are compliant with the standard

I have served as an elected `editor <https://docs.neuroml.org/NeuroMLOrg/Board.html>`__ (core maintainer) of the NeuroML standard and software stack since 2022.
This includes:

- maintaining the standard
- maintaining the core APIs and software tools
- maintaining/adding support for simulation engines, collaboratively with the help of the maintainers of these engines
- undertake outreach, dissemination, and training activities

LLM/AI assistance
====================

We are currently exploring methods by which we can leverage LLMs/AI tools to accelerate the building, fitting, simulation, and analysis of NeuroML models, especially to make modelling more accessible to the non-technical/non-computational neuroscience research community.

- **Status**: prototyping
- **Tools/technologies**: Python, Langchain_, RAG systems

-----

Open Source Brain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**2020** **-**

http://www.opensourcebrain.org/, https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/OSBv2

- **Status**: stable
- **Tools/technologies**: Python, Javascript, React/Redux, OpenAPI, Kubernetes, Docker, Google Cloud Platform

Open Source Brain is a cloud based integrated research platform for collaborative data analysis and computational modelling.

I am a core team member that maintains the platform and manages its development.

Community & leadership
-----------------------


OCNS
~~~~~

**2019 - 2021, 2023 -**

https://www.cnsorg.org

I am an elected member of the `Board of Directors for Organisation for Computational Neuroscience (OCNS) <https://www.cnsorg.org/board-of-directors>`__.
I was previously the "webmaster", in-charge of the website and infrastructure.

I am now in-charge of the OCNS `newsletter <https://www.cnsorg.org/newsletter>`__.


I also co-chair the `INCF/OCNS Software working group <https://ocns.github.io/SoftwareWG/>`__.
We focus on all things related to the software used in Neuroscience---development, training and dissemination.

-----

Fedora Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**2008 -**

https://fedoraproject.org

- **Tools/technologies**: Python, C/C++, Rust, RPM, Koji, Bash, Discourse, IRC, Matrix


I maintain >300 packages for the Fedora Linux distribution. I am also a sponsor to the package maintainers team, and have "proven packager" access to all community packages.

I am a core member of the `NeuroFedora`_ team. Our goal is to provide a large set of neuroscience software to users in an easy, ready to use way---via the Fedora_ Linux distribution.

I am also a core member of the `Fedora Join SIG`_ that helps to onboard new community members.

Others
~~~~~~

- I am a trained `Software Carpentry instructor <https://software-carpentry.org/>`__

I also contribute to a number of other neuroscience and Open Source software projects that can be seen on my `GitHub profile <https://github.com/sanjayankur31>`__.
