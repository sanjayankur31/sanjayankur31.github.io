:summary: Weekly update to week #22

Last Monday was the late spring bank holiday, so it was a four day week.

    NeuroML_ is a standard and software ecosystem for biophysically detailed neuronal modelling.


We've made some changes to the `NeuroML standard <https://github.com/NeuroML/NeuroML2/commit/fe3aa27d2ed146938be3efa19dfb15ddd8cc3804>`__ in the last week.
For neuron models, a few basic properties were optional so far:

- `spiking threshold potential <https://docs.neuroml.org/Userdocs/Schemas/Cells.html#spikethresh>`__
- `specific capacitance <https://docs.neuroml.org/Userdocs/Schemas/Cells.html#specificcapacitance>`__
- `initial membrane potential <https://docs.neuroml.org/Userdocs/Schemas/Cells.html#initmembpotential>`__

This is because the NEURON_ simulator, which is sort of the reference simulator for computational neuro-modelling, would use sane defaults if these values were not provided by the user.
However, since other simulators that `NeuroML supports <https://docs.neuroml.org/Userdocs/Software/SupportingTools.html>`__ may not fill in defaults, we decided that these properties should also be compulsory for the user to provide explicitly.

Updating the standard requires a few steps:

- update the `XSD schema <https://docs.neuroml.org/Userdocs/NeuroMLv2.html>`__
- regenerate the various APIs, e.g., `libNeuroML <https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/libNeuroML>`__
- run tests on all our models to see how many break with this backwards-incompatible change and fix them

The fall out doesn't seem too bad, and we've fixed the few models that needed fixes.

GSoC
-----

Our two GSoC candidates continue to make tweaks to their work.
This is still only the bonding period, so they're already ahead of time.
The contribution period only started this week, on the 27th.

We also had our weekly meeting where we discussed their tasks and concepts.



Fedora related
===============

More package updates on the Fedora side of things.
The NeuroFedora SIG will have its meeting next Monday.
We'll all catch up then to see if there are things that need prioritising.
