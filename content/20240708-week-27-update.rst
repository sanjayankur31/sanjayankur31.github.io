It's been a busy summer, so here's a consolidated post on what went on.

Conference: CNS 2024 in July
============================

The annual conference for computational neuroscience, held by the `Organization for Computational Neurosciences <https://www.cnsorg.org>`__ happens in July every year.
It alternates between Europe and non-Europe locations to ensure that it's accessible to as much of the research community as possible.
This year, it was organised in Natal, Brazil.

We had a tutorial on NeuroML_ and a couple of posters accepted at the conference.

I'm also on the `Board of Directors for CNS <https://www.cnsorg.org/board-of-directors>`__.
As part of my duties, I organised a career development session this year on life "beyond academia" where we had a panel of people who had trained in academia but now had moved on to non-academic careers.
The idea was to give students and early career researchers (ECRs) some idea of the "black box" that is industry, given that most of us have never worked in industry and therefore don't quite know anything about it at all, which makes it moving from academia to non-academic careers quite a daunting task.

Google Summer of Code
---------------------

Google Summer of Code finished recently.
Both Ioannis and Aditya passed their final evaulations, of course.
They both did great work.

Aditya completed implementing the SWC to NeuroML converter.
I reviewed his `PR and made some tweaks <https://github.com/NeuroML/pyNeuroML/pull/421>`__ before merging it in.
The new converter is now part of the recent `PyNeuroML 1.3.9 <https://pypi.org/project/pyNeuroML/1.3.9/>`__ release.
One can convert morphologies, for example from https://neuromorpho.org, using either the API or the command line tool:

.. code:: console

   pynml-swc2nml <swc file>


It runs a number of tests when loading the SWC file, and then validates the NeuroML once generated.


Now that we can export SWC files to NeuroML, we also can visualise them.
We first convert them to NeuroML and use our NeuroML visualisation tools.
This means that one can now do:

.. code:: console

   pynml-plotmorph -i <swc file>

One limitation to keep in mind with our handling of SWC is that each SWC file must only hold one neuron (cell), since this is what the standard that NeuroMorpho.org follows specifies.


Ioannis completed a number of tasks related to the Vispy viewer.
Initially, our code was using a small number of meshes with many `InstancedMesh <https://vispy.org/api/vispy.scene.visuals.html#vispy.scene.visuals.InstancedMesh>`__ objects because my understanding was that this was the most efficient way of going about it.
Later though, we realised that instead, we could just use one `Mesh <https://vispy.org/api/vispy.scene.visuals.html#vispy.scene.visuals.Mesh>`__ that included all our individual shapes (spheres and cylinders) and that would be much more performant.
So, I refactored our `visualization code <https://github.com/NeuroML/pyNeuroML/blob/development/pyneuroml/plot/PlotMorphologyVispy.py>`__ to use a single mesh.
This really simplified a number of things, including lighting and "picking".
We can also store the single mesh to a file so that it can be loaded in other analysis tools and visualisers like Paraview.
It opens up a bunch of possibilities of what we can do with the morphology visualisation.

Paper review responses
----------------------

A lot of our time went in responding to reviews for our `submission to E-Life <https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/95135>`__.
This is now complete, and our modifications and reviews have been submitted.
The `pre-print <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.07.570537v2>`__ has also been updated.

End of grant report
--------------------

We also had the end of grant report to write for our Wellcome grant that finished recently.
That took a bit of work right after CNS finished.
That's also done now and submitted.

We're now working on the next steps to secure another grant to keep the project going.

INCF/OCNS Software Working Group
================================


The INCF/OCNS Software Working group session is tomorrow:


`Software Working Group on the software tools their group develops <https://ocns.github.io/SoftwareWG/2024/06/27/wg-meeting-9-july-2024-software-tools-for-systems-neuroscience-adam-tyson-.html>`__.

Fedora related
===============

I merged a few packaging PRs and built packages for the various releases.
I also made a quick PR to the docs to include information about using `fkinit` when using 2FA---which is much easier than just using `kinit`.
