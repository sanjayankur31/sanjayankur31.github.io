:summary: Weekly update to week #27-#31

It's been a busy month, so here's a combined post on the past four weeks.

Conference: CNS 2024
====================

The annual conference for computational neuroscience, held by the `Organization for Computational Neurosciences <https://www.cnsorg.org>`__ happens in July every year.
It alternates between Europe and non-Europe locations to ensure that it's accessible to as much of the research community as possible.
This year, it was organised in Natal, Brazil.

We had a tutorial on NeuroML_ and a couple of posters accepted at the conference.

I'm also on the `Board of Directors for CNS <https://www.cnsorg.org/board-of-directors>`__.
As part of my duties, I organised a career development session this year on life "beyond academia" where we had a panel of people who had trained in academia but now had moved on to non-academic careers.
The idea was to give students and early career researchers (ECRs) some idea of the "black box" that is industry, given that most of us have never worked in industry and therefore don't quite know anything about it at all, which makes it moving from academia to non-academic careers quite a daunting task.

    NeuroML_ is a standard and software ecosystem for biophysically detailed neuronal modelling.


Google Summer of Code
---------------------

I merged Ioannis's `PR <https://github.com/NeuroML/pyNeuroML/pull/379>`__ that included tweaks to our 3D visualiser to make cells look "upright".
I also made some other tweaks to it to show the X, Y, Z, axes with the plots and improve the camera view.
Ioannis is now looking into `making our visualisations work in Jupyter notebooks <https://github.com/NeuroML/pyNeuroML/issues/359>`__.

I reviewed Aditya's `PR <https://github.com/NeuroML/pyNeuroML/pull/384>`__ and gave some feedback.
He's made his changes now, and I've got to do another review, hopefully tomorrow.
In the meantime, Aditya is playing with CVApp and other tools to gain a better understanding of the SWC to NeuroML conversion process.

Paper review responses
----------------------

We worked on replying to the reviewers' responses on our `submission to E-Life <https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/95135>`__.
We hope to send the updated version back in this week.
This took quite a while.


INCF/OCNS Software Working Group
================================


The INCF/OCNS Software Working group session is tomorrow:


`Software Working Group on the software tools their group develops <https://ocns.github.io/SoftwareWG/2024/06/27/wg-meeting-9-july-2024-software-tools-for-systems-neuroscience-adam-tyson-.html>`__.

Fedora related
===============

I merged a few packaging PRs and built packages for the various releases.
I also made a quick PR to the docs to include information about using `fkinit` when using 2FA---which is much easier than just using `kinit`.
