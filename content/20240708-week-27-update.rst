    NeuroML_ is a standard and software ecosystem for biophysically detailed neuronal modelling.


Google Summer of Code
---------------------

I merged Ioannis's `PR <https://github.com/NeuroML/pyNeuroML/pull/379>`__ that included tweaks to our 3D visualiser to make cells look "upright".
I also made some other tweaks to it to show the X, Y, Z, axes with the plots and improve the camera view.
Ioannis is now looking into `making our visualisations work in Jupyter notebooks <https://github.com/NeuroML/pyNeuroML/issues/359>`__.

I reviewed Aditya's `PR <https://github.com/NeuroML/pyNeuroML/pull/384>`__ and gave some feedback.
He's made his changes now, and I've got to do another review, hopefully tomorrow.
In the meantime, Aditya is playing with CVApp and other tools to gain a better understanding of the SWC to NeuroML conversion process.

Paper review responses
----------------------

We worked on replying to the reviewers' responses on our `submission to E-Life <https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/95135>`__.
We hope to send the updated version back in this week.
This took quite a while.


INCF/OCNS Software Working Group
================================


The INCF/OCNS Software Working group session is tomorrow:


`Software Working Group on the software tools their group develops <https://ocns.github.io/SoftwareWG/2024/06/27/wg-meeting-9-july-2024-software-tools-for-systems-neuroscience-adam-tyson-.html>`__.

Fedora related
===============

I merged a few packaging PRs and built packages for the various releases.
I also made a quick PR to the docs to include information about using `fkinit` when using 2FA---which is much easier than just using `kinit`.
