    NeuroML_ is a standard and software ecosystem for biophysically detailed neuronal modelling.



GSoC
-----

Work continues on this front.
Both Aditya and Ioannis already have pull requests open, so I've been reviewing them and providing feedback.
We're making sure we follow best practices right from the start---so doc strings, unit tests, type hints are all already in use.

I also added coverage information to our pyNeuroML_ CI.
It doesn't use a third party service like Coveralls/Codecov/Codespace at the moment.
It's a `combination of two GitHub actions <https://github.com/NeuroML/pyNeuroML/blob/development/.github/workflows/ci.yml#L56>`__---one summarises the coverage that we generate using pytest-cov, and the other comments on the pull request.
It works well enough.
The commenter action replaces to same comment each time too, so it doesn't spam the pull request with repeated comments.

This has pointed out that some of our code needs more testing, so we've put that on our agenda too now.


Model conversion
-----------------

I continued to work on converting the Purkinje cell model from `Zang et al <https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(18)31088-X>`__.
Using my test script, I've converted another couple of channels.


Fedora related
===============

Fixes, updates, and bug filing continues in the `NeuroFedora SIG <https://neuro.fedoraproject.org>`__.
