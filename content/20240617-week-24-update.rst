    NeuroML_ is a standard and software ecosystem for biophysically detailed neuronal modelling.


We made a few bug fixes to jLEMS_ to ensure that errors relating to dimensions and units do propagate all the way to the top level code and cause the model execution to stop.
The exceptions were being thrown correctly but they were being printed out to the user as warnings and not being allowed to propagate further.

While tinkering with this, I also found a minor bug in our SBML to LEMS conversion code.
One of the time constants in the generated LEMS code wasn't given the right dimensions.
It was a `simple enough fix <https://github.com/NeuroML/org.neuroml.import/pull/24>`__.

GSoC
-----

This is ticking along.
Aditya and Ioannis are still working on their tasks and pushing to their draft pull requests.
They should be ready to review next week.

Model conversion
-----------------

I'm still working on the converting the two remaining Calcium channels in `Zang et al <https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(18)31088-X>`__.
They're slightly trickier to convert because of the formalism they follow, but I should get there with another few days of work.
