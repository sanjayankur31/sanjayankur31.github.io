  abstract     = {Several homeostatic mechanisms enable the brain to maintain desired levels of neuronal activity. One of these, homeostatic structural plasticity, has been reported to restore activity in networks disrupted by peripheral lesions by altering their neuronal connectivity. While multiple lesion experiments have studied the changes in neurite morphology that underlie modifications of synapses in these networks, the underlying mechanisms that drive these changes are yet to be explained. Evidence suggests that neuronal activity modulates neurite morphology and may stimulate neurites to selective sprout or retract to restore network activity levels. We developed a new spiking network model of peripheral lesioning and accurately reproduced the characteristics of network repair after deafferentation that are reported in experiments to study the activity dependent growth regimes of neurites. To ensure that our simulations closely resemble the behaviour of networks in the brain, we model deafferentation in a biologically realistic balanced network model that exhibits low frequency Asynchronous Irregular (AI) activity as observed in cerebral cortex. Our simulation results indicate that the re-establishment of activity in neurons both within and outside the deprived region, the Lesion Projection Zone (LPZ), requires opposite activity dependent growth rules for excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic elements. Analysis of these growth regimes indicates that they also contribute to the maintenance of activity levels in individual neurons. Furthermore, in our model, the directional formation of synapses that is observed in experiments requires that pre-synaptic excitatory and inhibitory elements also follow opposite growth rules. Lastly, we observe that our proposed structural plasticity growth rules and the inhibitory synaptic plasticity mechanism that also balances our AI network both contribute to the restoration of the network to pre-deafferentation stable activity levels.},

  abstract  = {In spite of a plethora of peripheral lesion experiments documenting that structural plasticity causes large scale changes in brain networks, our understanding of the mechanisms of structural plasticity remains limited. Structural plasticity acts over extended periods of time, albeit at a slow rate, to modify network connectivity by the formation and removal of synapses. Alterations in network connectivity are expected to affect network function, but the resulting functional consequences of structural plasticity have not been studied in detail.To study the activity dependent growth characteristics of neurites, which underlie network reconfiguration, we previously developed a novel model of peripheral lesioning and subsequent repair in a balanced cortical Asynchronous Irregular (AI) spiking network [6]. The network used in our model, which represents a physiological brain network, was selected since it has been demonstrated to function as an attractor-less associative memory store [5]. Using this new model, we investigated the functional effects of repair mediated by homeostatic structural plasticity on the network. We stored associative memories in the network and recalled them at different stages of the simulation by stimulating a random subset of their neurons: before deafferentation, after deafferentation but before repair, and after deafferentation during repair. At each recall, recall performance was quantified using a Signal to Noise ratio (SNR) metric.Associative memories that include neurons deafferented by the peripheral lesion experience a reduction in their recall performance proportionate to the number of deprived neurons. Our results indicate that while structural plasticity restores activity of deafferented neurons to pre-injury levels, it does not restore the performance of the stored associative memories. This suggests that associative memories stored before a peripheral lesion are not necessarily protected in the repair process. Further research is needed to explore whether the repair process can be modulated to retain the performance of the stored associative memories.},
