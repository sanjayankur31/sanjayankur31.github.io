    NeuroML_ is a standard and software ecosystem for biophysically detailed neuronal modelling.



GSoC
-----

We had our first meeting of the contribution period last week.
Both candidates, Aditya and Ioannis, are already set up and well on their way.
Ioannis is continuing with the task that he had begun working on during the contribution period already---trying to get an "upright" view of single neurons in our 3D visualiser.
Aditya has started working on loading SWC files of neuronal reconstructions into an appropriate data structure that will make it easy to query the SWC morphology and validate it, and then eventually convert it into NeuroML.


Model conversion
-----------------

I continued to work on converting the Purkinje cell model from `Zang et al <https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(18)31088-X>`__.
I now have a `test scripts that plots the various state variables <https://github.com/sanjayankur31/243446/blob/feat/neuroml-conversion/NeuroML2/testks.py>`__ from the ion channels represented using kinetic schemes.
It adds the ion channel to a single compartmental cell, gives it a constant current to bring the state variables to their steady states, and plots these.
It does this both for the NEURON_ implementation and the NeuroML_ one so that I can compare the dynamics.

Fedora related
===============

Fixes, updates, and bug filing continues in the `NeuroFedora SIG <https://neuro.fedoraproject.org>`__.
It's ticking along nicely, as it tends to do.
