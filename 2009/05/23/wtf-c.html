 **"I Did It For You All..."**

 *On the 1st of January, 1998, Bjarne Stroustrup gave an interview to
 the IEEE's 'Computer' magazine..*

 Naturally, the editors thought he would be giving a retrospective
 view of seven years of object-oriented design, using the language he
 created.

 By the end of the interview, the interviewer got more than he had
 bargained for and, subsequently, the editor decided to suppress its
 contents, 'for the good of the industry' but, as with many of these
 things, there was a leak..

 Here is a complete transcript of what was was said, unedited, and
 unrehearsed, so it isn't as neat as planned interviews..

 You will find it interesting....

 | **Interviewer:** Well, it's been a few years since you changed the
 world of software design, how does it feel, looking back?
 |  **Stroustrup:** Actually, I was thinking about those days, just
 before you arrived. Do you remember? Everyone was writing 'C' and,
 the trouble was, they were pretty damn good at it.. Universities got
 pretty good at teaching it, too. They were turning out competent - I
 stress the word 'competent' - graduates at a phenomenal rate. That's
 what caused the problem..
 |  **Interviewer:** Problem?
 |  **Stroustrup:** Yes, problem. Remember when everyone wrote Cobol?
 |  **Interviewer:** Of course, I did too
 |  **Stroustrup:** Well, in the beginning, these guys were like
 demi-gods. Their salaries were high, and they were treated like
 royalty..
 |  **Interviewer:** Those were the days, eh?
 |  **Stroustrup:** Right. So what happened? IBM got sick of it, and
 invested millions in training programmers, till they were a dime a
 dozen..
 |  **Interviewer:** That's why I got out. Salaries dropped within a
 year, to the point where being a journalist actually paid better..
 |  **Stroustrup:** Exactly. Well, the same happened with 'C'
 programmers..
 |  **Interviewer:** I see, but what's the point?
 |  **Stroustrup:** Well, one day, when I was sitting in my office, I
 thought of this little scheme, which would redress the balance a
 little. I thought 'I wonder what would happen, if there were a
 language so complicated, so difficult to learn, that nobody would
 ever be able to swamp the market with programmers? Actually, I got
 some of the ideas from X10, you know, X windows. That was such a
 bitch of a graphics system, that it only just ran on those Sun 3/60
 things.. They had all the ingredients for what I wanted. A really
 ridiculously complex syntax, obscure functions, and pseudo-OO
 structure. Even now, nobody writes raw X-windows code. Motif is the
 only way to go if you want to retain your sanity..
 |  **Interviewer:** You're kidding...?
 |  **Stroustrup:** Not a bit of it. In fact, there was another
 problem.. Unix was written in 'C', which meant that any 'C'
 programmer could very easily become a systems programmer. Remember
 what a mainframe systems programmer used to earn?
 |  **Interviewer:** You bet I do, that's what I used to do..
 |  **Stroustrup:** OK, so this new language had to divorce itself
 from Unix, by hiding all the system calls that bound the two
 together so nicely. This would enable guys who only knew about DOS
 to earn a decent living too..
 |  **Interviewer:** I don't believe you said that....
 |  **Stroustrup:** Well, it's been long enough, now, and I believe
 most people have figured out for themselves that C++ is a waste of
 time but, I must say, it's taken them a lot longer than I thought it
 would..
 |  **Interviewer:** So how exactly did you do it?
 |  **Stroustrup:** It was only supposed to be a joke, I never
 thought people would take the book seriously. Anyone with half a
 brain can see that object-oriented programming is counter-intuitive,
 illogical and inefficient..
 |  **Interviewer:** What?
 |  **Stroustrup:** And as for 're-useable code' - when did you ever
 hear of a company re-using its code?
 |  **Interviewer:** Well, never, actually, but....
 |  **Stroustrup:** There you are then. Mind you, a few tried, in the
 early days. There was this Oregon company - Mentor Graphics, I think
 they were called - really caught a cold trying to rewrite everything
 in C++ in about '90 or '91. I felt sorry for them really, but I
 thought people would learn from their mistakes..
 |  **Interviewer:** Obviously, they didn't?
 |  **Stroustrup:** Not in the slightest. Trouble is, most companies
 hush-up all their major blunders, and explaining a $30 million loss
 to the shareholders would have been difficult.. Give them their due,
 though, they made it work in the end..
 |  **Interviewer:** They did? Well, there you are then, it proves
 O-O works..
 |  **Stroustrup:** Well, almost. The executable was so huge, it took
 five minutes to load, on an HP workstation, with 128MB of RAM. Then
 it ran like treacle. Actually, I thought this would be a major
 stumbling-block, and I'd get found out within a week, but nobody
 cared. Sun and HP were only too glad to sell enormously powerful
 boxes, with huge resources just to run trivial programs. You know,
 when we had our first C++ compiler, at AT&T, I compiled 'Hello
 World', and couldn't believe the size of the executable. 2.1MB
 |  **Interviewer:** What? Well, compilers have come a long way,
 since then..
 |  **Stroustrup:** They have? Try it on the latest version of g++ -
 you won't get much change out of half a megabyte. Also, there are
 several quite recent examples for you, from all over the world.
 British Telecom had a major disaster on their hands but, luckily,
 managed to scrap the whole thing and start again. They were luckier
 than Australian Telecom. Now I hear that Siemens is building a
 dinosaur, and getting more and more worried as the size of the
 hardware gets bigger, to accommodate the executables. Isn't multiple
 inheritance a joy?
 |  **Interviewer:** Yes, but C++ is basically a sound language..
 |  **Stroustrup:** You really believe that, don't you? Have you ever
 sat down and worked on a C++ project? Here's what happens: First,
 I've put in enough pitfalls to make sure that only the most trivial
 projects will work first time. Take operator overloading. At the end
 of the project, almost every module has it, usually, because guys
 feel they really should do it, as it was in their training course.
 The same operator then means something totally different in every
 module. Try pulling that lot together, when you have a hundred or so
 modules. And as for data hiding. God, I sometimes can't help
 laughing when I hear about the problems companies have making their
 modules talk to each other. I think the word 'synergistic' was
 specially invented to twist the knife in a project manager's ribs..
 |  **Interviewer:** I have to say, I'm beginning to be quite
 appalled at all this. You say you did it to raise programmers'
 salaries? That's obscene..
 |  **Stroustrup:** Not really. Everyone has a choice. I didn't
 expect the thing to get so much out of hand. Anyway, I basically
 succeeded. C++ is dying off now, but programmers still get high
 salaries - especially those poor devils who have to maintain all
 this crap. You do realise, it's impossible to maintain a large C++
 software module if you didn't actually write it?
 |  **Interviewer:** How come?
 |  **Stroustrup:** You are out of touch, aren't you? Remember the
 typedef?
 |  **Interviewer:** Yes, of course..
 |  **Stroustrup:**\ Remember how long it took to grope through the
 header files only to find that 'RoofRaised' was a double precision
 number? Well, imagine how long it takes to find all the implicit
 typedefs in all the Classes in a major project..
 |  **Interviewer:** So how do you reckon you've succeeded?
 |  **Stroustrup:** Remember the length of the average-sized 'C'
 project? About 6 months. Not nearly long enough for a guy with a
 wife and kids to earn enough to have a decent standard of living.
 Take the same project, design it in C++ and what do you get? I'll
 tell you. One to two years. Isn't that great? All that job security,
 just through one mistake of judgment. And another thing. The
 universities haven't been teaching 'C' for such a long time, there's
 now a shortage of decent 'C' programmers. Especially those who know
 anything about Unix systems programming. How many guys would know
 what to do with 'malloc', when they've used 'new' all these years -
 and never bothered to check the return code. In fact, most C++
 programmers throw away their return codes. Whatever happened to good
 ol' '-1'? At least you knew you had an error, without bogging the
 thing down in all that 'thrthe product out, knowing it leaks like a
 sieve, simply to avoid the expense of tracking them all down..
 |  **Interviewer:** There are tools.....
 |  **Stroustrup:**\ Most of which were written in C++.
 |  **Interviewer:** If we publish this, you'll probably get lynched,
 you do realise that?
 |  **Stroustrup:** I doubt it. As I said, C++ is way past its peak
 now, and no company in its right mind would start a C++ project
 without a pilot trial. That should convince them that it's the road
 to disaster. If not, they deserve all they get.. You know, I tried
 to convince Dennis Ritchie to rewrite Unix in C++..
 |  **Interviewer:** Oh my God. What did he say?
 |  **Stroustrup:** Well, luckily, he has a good sense of humor. I
 think both he and Brian figured out what I was doing, in the early
 days, but never let on. He said he'd help me write a C++ version of
 DOS, if I was interested..
 |  **Interviewer:** Were you?
 |  **Stroustrup:** Actually, I did write DOS in C++, I'll give you a
 demo when we're through. I have it running on a Sparc 20 in the
 computer room. Goes like a rocket on 4 CPU's, and only takes up 70
 megs of disk..
 |  **Interviewer:** What's it like on a PC?
 |  **Stroustrup:** Now you're kidding. Haven't you ever seen Windows
 '95? I think of that as my biggest success. Nearly blew the game
 before I was ready, though..
 |  **Interviewer:** You know, that idea of a Unix++ has really got
 me thinking. Somewhere out there, there's a guy going to try it..
 |  **Stroustrup:** Not after they read this interview..
 |  **Interviewer:** I'm sorry, but I don't see us being able to
 publish any of this..
 |  **Stroustrup:** But it's the story of the century. I only want to
 be remembered by my fellow programmers, for what I've done for them.
 You know how much a C++ guy can get these days?
 |  **Interviewer:** Last I heard, a really top guy is worth $70 -
 $80 an hour..
 |  **Stroustrup:** See? And I bet he earns it. Keeping track of all
 the gotchas I put into C++ is no easy job. And, as I said before,
 every C++ programmer feels bound by some mystic promise to use every
 damn element of the language on every project. Actually, that really
 annoys me sometimes, eve. I almost like the language after all this
 time..
 |  **Interviewer:** You mean you didn't before?
 |  **Stroustrup:** Hated it. It even looks clumsy, don't you agree?
 But when the book royalties started to come in... well, you get the
 picture..
 |  **Interviewer:** Just a minute. What about references? You must
 admit, you improved on 'C' pointers..
 |  **Stroustrup:** Hmm. I've always wondered about that. Originally,
 I thought I had. Then, one day I was discussing this with a guy
 who'd written C++ from the beginning. He said he could never
 remember whether his variables were referenced or dereferenced, so
 he always used pointers. He said the little asterisk always reminded
 him..
 |  **Interviewer:** Well, at this point, I usually say 'thank you
 very much' but it hardly seems adequate..
 |  **Stroustrup:** Promise me you'll publish this. My conscience is
 getting the better of me these days..
 |  **Interviewer:** I'll let you know, but I think I know what my
 editor will say..
 |  **Stroustrup:** Who'd believe it anyway? Although, can you send
 me a copy of that tape?
 |  **Interviewer:** I can do that.
