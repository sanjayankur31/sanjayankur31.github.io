&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've recently resurrected the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/NeuroFedora"&gt;NeuroFedora SIG&lt;/a&gt;. Many thanks to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Ignatenkobrain"&gt;Igor&lt;/a&gt; and the others who had
worked on it in the past and have given us a firm base to build on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-goal"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The goal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The (current) goal of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/NeuroFedora"&gt;NeuroFedora SIG&lt;/a&gt; is to make Fedora an easy to use
platform for neuroscientists. We aim to do this by making commonly used
Neuroscience software easily installable on a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org"&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt; system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroscience is an extremely multidisciplinary field. It brings together
mathematicians, chemists, biologists, physicists, psychologists, engineers
(electrical and others), computer scientists and more. A lot of software is used
nowadays in Neuroscience for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;data collection, analysis, and sharing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lots of image processing (a lot of ML is used here, think Data Science)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;simulation of brain networks (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/"&gt;NEURON&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://nest-simulator.org"&gt;Nest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/BhallaLab/moose"&gt;Moose&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/PyNN"&gt;PyNN&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://briansimulator.org/"&gt;Brian&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dissemination of scientific results (peer reviewed and otherwise, think
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://tug.org/"&gt;LaTeX&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that a large proportion of neuroscientists are not trained in
computer science, a lot of time and effort is spent setting up systems,
installing software (often building whole &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell"&gt;dependency chains&lt;/a&gt; from source). This can be
hard for people not well-versed in build systems and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/NeuroFedora"&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt;, we will provide a ready to use &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org"&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt; based system for
neuroscientists to work with, so they can quickly get their environment set up
and work on the science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="why-fedora"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Fedora?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one, I have been a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Ankursinha"&gt;contributor&lt;/a&gt; for a while and know the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://apps.fedoraproject.org/"&gt;community and the infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; quite
well. That applies to me and others from the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org"&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt; community that may work on
this and not the research community in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically, there are many advantages of using &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org"&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt; as a base.
Fedora is closely linked to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux"&gt;Red Hat Enterprise Linux&lt;/a&gt;
eco system---which &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.centos.org/"&gt;Cent OS&lt;/a&gt; is a part of and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.scientificlinux.org/about/"&gt;Scientific Linux is&lt;/a&gt; is based on
too (Recently, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://coreos.com/"&gt;CoreOS also joined the Red Hat family&lt;/a&gt;). RPM based systems are commonly deployed in
supercomputers and clusters. So, making this software available on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org"&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt; also
makes it simpler to make it available on these systems.  Additionally, the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org"&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt; community is promoting &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://flatpak.org/"&gt;Flatpaks&lt;/a&gt;, and working to permit multiple
versions of software via the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/modularity/"&gt;modularity&lt;/a&gt; system. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org"&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt; also supports &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.docker.com/"&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt;
very &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Docker"&gt;well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="join-us"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Join us!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packaging software is only &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; way in which one can contribute.  Writing docs
and answering questions about the software in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/NeuroFedora"&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; are other ways too,
for example.  If you are interested in neuroscience and in promoting &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science"&gt;Open
Science&lt;/a&gt;, please consider
joining the SIG. You can get in touch with us via one of our many
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/NeuroFedora#Communication_and_getting_help"&gt;communication channels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This invitation extends to all--undergraduates, post-graduates, trainee
researchers (PhD candidates like me), professional researchers, hobbyists, and
everyone else.  If you work in the field already, it is a great way of
supporting the research community. For others, it is a great place to
learn about neuroscience, and  &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/user-liberation-watch-and-share-our-new-video"&gt;Free Software&lt;/a&gt;
and the various technical skills that go into developing software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="current-status"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Current status&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We track the software we are working on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/NeuroFedora/PackageSet"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. A lot of
software is now ready to use in Fedora. This includes various Python libraries
and simulators such as &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://nest-simulator.org"&gt;Nest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/BhallaLab/moose"&gt;Moose&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/"&gt;Neuron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://briansimulator.org/"&gt;Brian&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/PyNN"&gt;PyNN&lt;/a&gt; are all in
the pipeline. All of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://tug.org/texlive/"&gt;TeX Live&lt;/a&gt; is also available in
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org"&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt;. If there is other Free/Open source software that you use which isn't
on our list, please let us know.  If you can help maintain it with us, that'll
be even better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="fedora-free-software-and-science"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fedora/Free software and Science&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open science shares the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/"&gt;philosophy of FOSS&lt;/a&gt;. The data, the tools, the results, should
be accessible to all to understand, use, learn from, and develop. More and more
researchers are making it a point to keep Science as open as possible whether
it is to do with the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://opensourceforneuroscience.org/"&gt;tools&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access"&gt;dissemination&lt;/a&gt; of their
findings. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/NeuroFedora"&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; hopes to aid this movement. Come, join us!&lt;/p&gt;

could use the mobile applications. The mobile applications get their data from
the integration server, which provides an API. So, I looked at how to set it up
and document my findings in this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://connfa.com/"&gt;Connfa&lt;/a&gt; CMS server is a php application that uses a MySQL database.  To
begin with, the documentation here is quite good:
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://connfa.com/documentation/"&gt;http://connfa.com/documentation/&lt;/a&gt;.  However, as is usually seen, it takes a
few tweaks to deploy it.  These steps are therefore, Fedora 28 specific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Fedora, one needs to use php71 from remi's repository:
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.remirepo.net/pages/Config-en"&gt;https://blog.remirepo.net/pages/Config-en&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code bash literal-block"&gt;
sudo dnf install php71 composer php71-php-mysqlnd mariadb httpd mariadb-server php71-php-xml
sudo systemctl start php71-php-fpm
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl start mysqld
module load php71
php --version
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because the tool doesn't work with the latest version of php that's in
Fedora 28. The tool also has a bug or two, so I used this fork that appears to
have a bugfix:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/d-i-t-a/connfa-integration-server/tree/develop"&gt;https://github.com/d-i-t-a/connfa-integration-server/tree/develop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, one must set up &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://mariadb.org/"&gt;Mariadb&lt;/a&gt; as explained here:
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/MariaDB"&gt;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/MariaDB&lt;/a&gt;. Note that &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://mariadb.org/"&gt;Mariadb&lt;/a&gt; is an Open source
MySQL implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One must also create a database as explained in the wiki page, and a user that
connfa can use, which must match the values in the &lt;code&gt;env&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Fedora, I enabled the &lt;code&gt;UserDir&lt;/code&gt; httpd extension, and placed the
connfa-integration-server in &lt;code&gt;~/public_html/&lt;/code&gt;, since I didn't want to
work as root in &lt;code&gt;/var/www/html&lt;/code&gt; all the time. &lt;code&gt;httpd&lt;/code&gt; will needs to
be started and enabled:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code bash literal-block"&gt;
sudo systemctl start httpd&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; sudo systemctl &lt;span class="nb"&gt;enable&lt;/span&gt; httpd
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Fedora, Selinux must be asked to allow access to UserDirs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code bash literal-block"&gt;
sudo setsebool -P httpd_read_user_content &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
sudo setsebool -P httpd_unified &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
sudo setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect_db &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
sudo setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can follow the steps from here next:
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://connfa.com/integration-server/server-requirements"&gt;http://connfa.com/integration-server/server-requirements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also run &lt;code&gt;composer update&lt;/code&gt; to update the php bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, update the env file and so on as explained here:
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://connfa.com/integration-server/install/"&gt;http://connfa.com/integration-server/install/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code bash literal-block"&gt;
php artisan key:generate &lt;span class="c1"&gt;#sets the keys in the env file
&lt;/span&gt;php artisan password:change --name&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;admin --password&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;connfa18
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site should be accessible at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://localhost"&gt;http://localhost&lt;/a&gt;/~&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;/public/login/
The username is &lt;code&gt;admin&amp;#64;test.com&lt;/code&gt; here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The API is accessible at:
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://localhost"&gt;http://localhost&lt;/a&gt;/~&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;/public/api/v2/cns-2018/checkUpdates&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did have quite a few issues with permissions, but then I'm neither a web
developer nor a server administrator, so my skills in the department are rather
limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll look at the Android application next, and hopefully, I'll be able to sync
it up with the CMS server.&lt;/p&gt;

where I walked through the basics of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://git-scm.com/"&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt;. This is a quick summary
of the session.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I taught another &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Classroom"&gt;Fedora Classroom&lt;/a&gt; this week, on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://meetbot.fedoraproject.org/fedora-classroom/2017-10-05/fedora-classroom.2017-10-05-14.17.log.html"&gt;Git 101&lt;/a&gt;. I used the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat"&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt;
again since this session was to be another hands-on walkthrough. I reckon I've
now learned that hands-on sessions go on longer than initially planned. This
one lasted about three hours!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="some-metrics"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some metrics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Length: 3 hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attendees: ~25 people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sentences spoken: LOTS!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="summary"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't go much into the theory, and there's a lot of it in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://git-scm.com/"&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, I
had made it my goal to walk the attendees through the usual &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://git-scm.com/"&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; workflow.
So, that's exactly what we did. We started by setting up an empty repository,
then added files to it, learned how to see changes and so on. Then, we moved
on to branching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we'd explored the advantages of using branches we started working with
remotes. Everyone set up repositories on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io"&gt;Pagure&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;. To end with, I
got everyone to fork my repository and submit pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think everyone got the hang of it. There were some good questions, a bit of
discussion too. I do hope it'll get more people to use &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://git-scm.com/"&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; and contribute to
different projects on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io"&gt;Pagure&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="feedback-is-always-welcome"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Feedback is always welcome&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you had attended the session, or have gone through the logs and have some
feedback, please get in touch. You can use the Fedora classroom channels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can even comment on this blog post, and of course, you can give me feedback
privately. I'm FranciscoD on quite a few Fedora IRC channels, and I can be
reached via e-mail on my Fedora address at ankursinha AT fedoraproject DOT org.

&lt;p&gt;The classroom sessions are going rather well, but &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Classroom#Help_wanted"&gt;we still need more help&lt;/a&gt;. We'd like to cover
more topics from different areas, not just tech related- everything from
design, to free software philosophy and community building! If there's anything
at all you think is worth a classroom session, please get in touch with the

This is a quick summary of the session.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We've gotten the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Classroom"&gt;Fedora classroom&lt;/a&gt; sessions going again. After two really good ones, I taught the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fedoramagazine.org/fedora-classroom-session-3/"&gt;third one&lt;/a&gt; today - a beginners session to the command line. Unlike the previous ones that used video platforms, I decided that the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat"&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt; was best suited to this session, even more so because I wanted it to be a hands-on session. It went off pretty well. Here are a few notes. Links to the logs are at the bottom of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="some-metrics"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some metrics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Length: 2 hours (was planned to be an hour, but we quickly realised that it wouldn't be enough!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attendees: 29 - a few of us had FAS usernames too (so we shared cookies!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About 800 sentences were spoken (I spoke about half of these, of course)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="summary"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quite enjoyed it, but then I enjoy tinkering with the command line anyway. A few folks stuck around for the full two hours, so that does indicate that they found the session somewhat useful. I'd put up a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/sanjayankur31/f40070c6925e8885394d2dd750ae4cb8"&gt;gist here with a tentative agenda&lt;/a&gt;. We didn't manage to go more than half way through it, though. We:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;did a quick introduction to what a shell is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learned how to get help using local information - using the man pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;quickly saw the difference between absolute and relative paths, and also learned about &lt;code&gt;..&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;went on to look at some more basic commands/built-ins and their switches/flags/options: &lt;code&gt;ls, apropos, clear, cd, pwd, which, alias, rm, tree, mkdir, wget, rmdir, rm, fpaste, wc, head, tail, more, less, cat, tac, grep, sort, uniq&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;used these commands to download a copy of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1120/pg1120.txt"&gt;&amp;quot;The tragedy of Julius Caesar&amp;quot; from Project Gutenberg&lt;/a&gt;, and then extracted some information from it. For example, we obtained how many times Caesar was mentioned in the text. For a more advanced task we also obtained how many times Caesar, Brutus, Cassius, and Casca were each mentioned using a single set of commands. This required the use of &lt;code&gt;grep, sort, uniq, wc&lt;/code&gt; in different combinations using input-output redirection (pipes in this case). At no point did we use a text editor, and we stuck to using local man pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="takeaways"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that this rather quick session gave the participants some idea of how the shell can be used for lots of tasks. I also hoped to show them that there's a lot of information available on the system itself that a user can refer to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned a few things myself. I learned that an hour is too short for a proper online session, for example. My supposition that demonstrating commands using tasks would make the session more appealing seems to have been correct too. Only, maybe next time I'll pick a more contemporary text?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the next session, I'll try and cover slightly more advanced topics, such as tests, loops, maybe even a bit of awk. We shall see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="feedback-is-always-welcome"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Feedback is always welcome&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you had attended the session, or have gone through the logs and have some feedback, please get in touch. You can use the Fedora classroom channels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:classroom&amp;#64;lists.fedoraproject.org"&gt;mailing list&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#fedora-classroom on Freenode &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23fedora-classroom"&gt;IRC channel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can even comment on this blog post, and of course, you can give me feedback privately. I'm also looking to make a list of tasks that I can use in future sessions - tasks that would be useful, fun, and that would also require some command line tricks - such that they would demonstrate the power of the command line. So, if you have your pet command line tricks/aliases, please do get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm FranciscoD on quite a few Fedora IRC channels, and I can be reached via e-mail on my Fedora address at ankursinha AT fedoraproject DOT org. All suggestions, comments, criticism is most welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="more-instructors-needed"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More instructors needed!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classroom sessions are going rather well, but &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Classroom#Help_wanted"&gt;we still need more help&lt;/a&gt;. We need more people helping with logistics, and of course, if we are to continue these sessions every week, we need more instructors! If there's anything at all you think is worth a classroom session, please get in touch with the team on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:classroom&amp;#64;lists.fedoraproject.org"&gt;Fedora classroom mailing list&lt;/a&gt;. A log of all past sessions - whether on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat"&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt; or on a video platform are maintained on the wiki page &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Classroom#Previous_Sessions"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for everyone to peruse at their convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

When teams on different communication platforms want to collaborate, though - there's a bit of an issue. In this post, I document how one can setup channels on various platforms (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://slack.com"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat"&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gitter.im"&gt;Gitter&lt;/a&gt;) and bring them all together on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://riot.im"&gt;Riot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;div class="section" id="let-s-not-let-our-choice-of-platform-limit-us"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Let's not let our choice of platform limit us&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are usually multiple platforms that provide similar functions. For instance, one can pick between &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gitlab.com"&gt;GitLab&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.com"&gt;BitBucket&lt;/a&gt; for collaborative development interfaces, and one certainly should have the freedom to do so. Similarly, one can use different operating systems, web browsers, phones, etc etc etc. But, one must remember is that for a lot of us, these are simply means to an end - not the end themselves. They are tools that facilitate the completion of our goals. Different individuals or teams preferring different platforms should not hamper collaboration under any circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to communcation, different teams use different platforms. Some prefer e-mails - either private or using a mailing list. E-mails work well, but they're often overkill for simpler tasks. They're also not the best mode for quick collaborative development. This is where real-time chat comes in. Most open source communities maintain both mailing lists and chat infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to chat platforms too, there are multiple options. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat"&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gitter.im"&gt;Gitter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://riot.im"&gt;Riot&lt;/a&gt; are designed to handle large communities and are therefore, usually preferred by open source communities. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://slack.com"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; seems to be preferred by smaller teams. There are others - &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://mattermost.com"&gt;Mattermost&lt;/a&gt;, for example, but I haven't much experience with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, I've found people wary of hopping on to a different platform simply because it's too much work to set up yet another client that one must then also monitor. While this is understandable, it then has what I consider quite a major downside - limited communication amongst groups that are on different platforms. Fortunately, most platforms support bridges which lets the user connect them with other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="riot-bringing-it-all-together-in-once-place"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Riot - bringing it all together in once place&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://ankursinha.in/images/20170628-riot.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Using riot to access IRC, Slack, and Gitter" class="text-center img-responsive pagination-centered" src="http://ankursinha.in/images/20170628-riot.png" style="width: 70%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://riot.im"&gt;Riot&lt;/a&gt; is an Open source platform that uses the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://matrix.org/"&gt;Matrix&lt;/a&gt; protocol. It's similar to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat"&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt;, but it's a lot more usable. and what is better, one can integrate &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat"&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://slack.com"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gitter.im"&gt;Gitter&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://riot.im"&gt;Riot&lt;/a&gt; - so one can interact with users over all these platforms in one place. For example, the image below shows &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://riot.im/app/#/room/%23neuroscience-central-lobby:matrix.org"&gt;Neuroscience-central/Lobby&lt;/a&gt; room  that I've set up on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://riot.im"&gt;Riot&lt;/a&gt;. But, I've also gone ahead and connected this room to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gitter.im/neuroscience-central/Lobby"&gt;Neuroscience-central/Lobby room on Gitter&lt;/a&gt;, and to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#neuroscience-central-lobby"&gt;#neuroscience-central-lobby channel on IRC&lt;/a&gt;. So, everyone on any of these platforms can communicate with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://ankursinha.in/images/20170628-riot-gitter.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Neuroscience-Central/Lobby on Riot integrated with the same room on Gitter." class="text-center img-responsive pagination-centered" src="http://ankursinha.in/images/20170628-riot-gitter.png" style="width: 70%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setting up the integrations is rather easy too. One needs to go to the integrations tab and set them up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://ankursinha.in/images/20170628-riot-integrations.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Integrations on Riot" class="text-center img-responsive pagination-centered" src="http://ankursinha.in/images/20170628-riot-integrations.png" style="width: 70%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://riot.im/desktop.html"&gt;desktop clients&lt;/a&gt; available for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://riot.im"&gt;Riot&lt;/a&gt; too. (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/taw/Riot/"&gt;Here's a COPR for Fedora&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://opensource.com/article/17/5/introducing-riot-IRC"&gt;Here's a great post on opensource.com&lt;/a&gt; discussing &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://riot.im"&gt;Riot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you're an admin looking to set up a new chat channel - consider setting up on different platforms and integrating them with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://riot.im"&gt;Riot&lt;/a&gt; - it'll make things a lot easier for your users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

While mailing lists suit certain purposes, open source communities tend to use a combination of mailing lists and chat channels - each platform serves different purposes. TLDR: here's a new chat channel on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/gitterHQ"&gt;Gitter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gitter.im/neuroscience-central/Lobby"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for everything neuroscience related. It is also accessible using the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#neuroscience-central-lobby"&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://riot.im/app/#/room/#neuroscience-central-lobby:matrix.org"&gt;Riot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As opposed to the free software community, where I've been around long enough to know what's where, I'm still relatively new to the neuroscience community. Over the two years that I've been doing my PhD, I've found a few neuroscience related mailing lists, but not any chat channels. Various teams tend to use &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://slack.com/"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; or another platform for internal communications, but nothing seems to be set up for the community in general - an open for all channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mailing lists are extremely useful, but by design they are suited to particular types of tasks. They are very well suited for longer discussions, and general queries that are not time sensitive, for example. On the other hand, they do not work well for urgent queries, and of course, sometimes sending e-mails back and forth is quite an overhead for simpler tasks or collaborative development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most open source communities have both mailing lists and chat channels. I figured it'd be nice to have one for the neuroscience community too. There's the question of what platform was best suited, of course. We use &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://slack.com/"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; for our internal communication, but &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://slack.com/"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; only works well for small teams. It isn't designed for larger communities. The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat"&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt; is ideal for larger communities, but on the flip side, the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat"&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt; is not very user friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third option, and the popular alternative to IRC and Slack, is &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/gitterHQ"&gt;Gitter&lt;/a&gt; - it's been recently &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://about.gitlab.com/2017/03/15/gitter-acquisition/"&gt;acquired by GitLab&lt;/a&gt; and will be completely open sourced soon. It's completely free to use unlike &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://slack.com/"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; where one needs to pay more as the number of group members increases, and is designed for large communities that number in the thousands. One can login using either Github or Twitter - so that's quite convenient too. There's even an &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://irc.gitter.im/"&gt;IRC gateway&lt;/a&gt; for more technical users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here's the channel then - &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gitter.im/neuroscience-central/Lobby"&gt;https://gitter.im/neuroscience-central/Lobby&lt;/a&gt;. I hope it'll be useful, and if it doesn't, well no harm done :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update (12 July 2017):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enable people to communicate over various platforms, I've also set the channel up with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://riot.im"&gt;Riot&lt;/a&gt;. This enables people using &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/gitterHQ"&gt;Gitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat"&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://riot.im"&gt;Riot&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ankursinha.in/2017/07/12/bringing-together-gitter-irc-and-slack-channels-in-one-place-on-riot.html"&gt;communicate with each other in one place using whatever platform they prefer&lt;/a&gt;. So, we also have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#neuroscience-central-lobby"&gt;#neuroscience-central-lobby&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat"&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://riot.im/app/#/room/#neuroscience-central-lobby:matrix.org"&gt;neuroscience-central/Lobby&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://riot.im"&gt;Riot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Some of these people will take the time to inform the developers of these issues. Some of these issues that have been reported will be looked at by developers. Some of the issues that the developers look at will contain enough information to encourage the developers to work on a fix. Ultimately, only a handful of issues will be fixed. In this post, I encourage users to report issues to developers the right way - increasing the chances of the bug being corrected. In the process, not only does one improve one's personal experience, one can help improve the experience of other users, while helping developers make their software better. The intended target here is not the developer community - they already know most all of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;&lt;div class="section" id="prologue"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prologue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, software is ubiquitous - banking, healthcare, driving, communicating, mobile apps that do the most random (often unnecessary) tasks. One often runs into software issues (bugs). It could be a niggle where say, a button in the app doesn't react instantaneously, or it could be a much more critical scenario where a laptop frequently crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I've heard quite a few users complain about software that isn't working &amp;quot;as it should&amp;quot;, but I've also noticed that very few of them tend to take the extra step of reporting the issue so that it may be fixed. Instead, they either continue using the application hoping that it'll be fixed in the future sometime or simply switch from alternative to alternative. Of course, bugs that affect large numbers of users are often well known and are fixed in a timely manner. On the other hand, the odd bug that affects a select set of users often remains untouched, for various reasons - usually either because it hasn't been reported, or because it isn't important enough to prioritise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, before I go any further, I want to note that proprietary software is more often than not developed behind closed doors. So, I do not actively encourage users to submit bugs for proprietary software simply because if they hit a wall, I do not know where to even begin assisting them. I try to stick to free and open source software (FOSS) myself, and when I do run into an issue with proprietary applications that I use out of necessity, I drop the support folks an e-mail if contact information is readily available. However, with FOSS, the software life cycle is quite transparent. Issue trackers are accessible, so is the source-code, and so are various documents regarding planning, usage, and development. In most cases, the developers are easily accessible too. So for FOSS, I encourage people to file tickets when they run into genuine issues because it does make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="software-is-complex-accept-that-it-can-have-bugs"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Software is complex - accept that it can have bugs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software issues result in exasperation. &amp;quot;Why can't the damn thing just work?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;How hard is it to write software that just works?&amp;quot; Turns, out, it is actually quite hard. Apps nowadays are rarely isolated programs. They rely on various frameworks, APIs, libraries, even hardware, to provide a service. In order for a program to &amp;quot;work correctly&amp;quot;, the entire stack must function correctly, whereas a failure anywhere in the stack can result in unexpected behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a simplified example, take a web browser. One types in the address of one's favourite social media website, and boom - all eight hundred &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; are right there. Under the hood, though, there's a lot happening. Your web browser must use the right parts of the operating system to access the Internet, for example. Only then can it contact servers all over the world to get the right information. Nowadays, with the increased stress on privacy, the browser must use cryptography to ensure that one's personal data cannot be read by others while in transit. After it has gathered the data it needs, it must again use the right bits of the operating system via various interfaces to display this information on the output device - usually the screen. There are multiple layers that are piled up one on top of the other to make the application. Most software is also developed by teams of developers, so while a single developer usually does not need to know the entire stack, but a general idea is a must. Collaborative software development also implies that different chunks of the source are written and handled by different people, and all of it plugs together to form the finished application that an end user interacts with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if writing software is hard, turns out, making software &amp;quot;bug-free&amp;quot; is even harder. In spite of all the testing (QA) that software may go through, it is extremely rare for it to be declared &amp;quot;bug free&amp;quot;. Bugs and bug-fixing is part of the software development lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I do not say that software must have issues. I'm just saying that given how complex contemporary software is, it's likely that it will have some issues. This does not make it acceptable for developers to release below par software, of course!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="be-nice-rage-is-never-the-answer"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Be nice - rage is never the answer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand that if one pays for software, one should get the best possible user experience out of it. True. All I'm saying is that even commercial software can have bugs in it, hurling expletives towards the developers (individuals, corporations, whatever!) is unwarranted. Even if it is a fundamental issue that makes the software unusable, such an overreaction will do little to improve one's experience - all it'll do is spoil one's day. Rage is never the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, in the case of FOSS, which users get free of all cost, I personally feel that an aggressive reaction is quite unacceptable. This is not to say that FOSS is below par just because it is free of cost. I say this because FOSS is based on communities, where a lot of people contribute because they enjoy extending the freedom they have to others. A lot of people I know contribute to FOSS in the time they save from both professional and personal life. So, if contributors can be nice enough to work in their free time to develop such great software, the least users can do is be respectful in their communications. It doesn't feel like much of an ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What interests and often confuses me here is that it isn't only end users with a lack of software development knowledge that engage in rage. It is often people that are developers themselves, often free software enthusiasts, that also partake in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, it's software, it can have issues, there's no need to kick up a storm about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="filing-bugs"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Filing bugs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to the main bit now. Filing a bug is quite simple, but there are a few things to keep in mind that improve the chances of a bug being fixed sooner. The goal when filing a bug, of course, is to provide the right person with the right information that will help isolate the issue. For example, informing the wrong person will not help, and neither will providing the right person the wrong information. In fact, badly filed bugs make it harder for developers to fix issues, because they contribute noise that developers must then spend extra time sifting through to find the relevant information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in steps, with a Fedora centric context (similar steps should be followed for all other operating systems in general):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="check-that-the-latest-stable-version-of-the-software-is-in-use"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Check that the latest stable version of the software is in use&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New versions of software bring improvements and bug fixes. If one is using an old, out of date version of software, one must first update to the latest supported version. Using Windows XP, for example, which isn't supported any more is a very bad idea. So is using a version of Fedora that isn't supported anymore. So is using an older version of any application - because the newer release would contain various bugfixes and enhancements that could quite possibly have fixed the issue one is experiencing already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using up to date software is extremely important - various security vulnerabilities in applications can provide a malicious user access to a lot of one's data among other things. Such bugs are often known beforehand and updated versions of software fixes these bugs. An example is the recent spyware attack that has been in the news all week, and has cost a lot of money - &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack"&gt;WannaCry&lt;/a&gt; (Google will provide enough information to read).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a bug that's already been fixed in the latest version is filed, developers will simply request the user to update to the latest version. So, before one files an issue, one should check if one is using the latest version. The simplest approach is to run a full system update and then re-check if the bug still persists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="provide-the-right-information-in-the-bug-report"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Provide the right information in the bug report&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Fedora users, bugs should be reported to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://redhat.bugzilla.com"&gt;RedHat Bugzilla instance&lt;/a&gt;. One is required to register, but only once, and it's very simple - only an -mail address is required so that notifications regarding updates on various bugs can be sent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bugzilla itself contains quite a lot of information, and may not be the most usable interface for users that are not also developers. Luckily, the Fedora infrastructure team has set up other web applications that make it very easy to get to the required Bugzilla form. I usually follow the following process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, I find the right package using the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/"&gt;Fedora packages application&lt;/a&gt;. For example, in the screenshot below, I'm looking for the package that my web browser belongs to. It could either be Firefox, or if not, Epiphany maybe?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://ankursinha.in/images/20170516-packages-app.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Fedora packages web application" class="text-center img-responsive pagination-centered" src="http://ankursinha.in/images/20170516-packages-app.png" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From there, I go to the page for that particular package. For example, here's the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/firefox"&gt;page for the Firefox browser&lt;/a&gt;. As the screenshot shows, this page shows various information about the package, including what bugs are currently filed against it. It also provides links to other Fedora web applications that provide other information, but I won't discuss them all here now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://ankursinha.in/images/20170516-packages-firefox.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Firefox on the Fedora packages web application" class="text-center img-responsive pagination-centered" src="http://ankursinha.in/images/20170516-packages-firefox.png" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, one can go through the list of bugs to see if something similar has already been reported. One can also use the search box to search through Bugzilla. One doesn't have to search for existing bugs, of course, one can simply file a new bug using the links at the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: commenting on an existing bug is a better way to inform the developers of an issue, since it lets them know that multiple users are experiencing it. If a duplicate bug is filed, a maintainer will close it as exactly that: a DUPLICATE. More information on Bugzilla bug statuses can be found &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/page.cgi?id=fields.html#bug_status"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clicking on &amp;quot;File a Fedora bug&amp;quot; here will take us to an empty bug report form on Bugzilla ready to be filled in! The Bugzilla maintainers already provide a template, as the screenshot shows:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://ankursinha.in/images/20170516-bugzilla-form.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="An empty bug report form on Bugzilla" class="text-center img-responsive pagination-centered" src="http://ankursinha.in/images/20170516-bugzilla-form.png" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;div class="section" id="the-bugzilla-form-explained"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Bugzilla form explained&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The different fields that can be selected:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Product: Fedora for all Fedora bugs - already set if the Fedora packages web app was used to get here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Component: The package name - already set if the Fedora packages web app was used to get here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Version: The Fedora version in use - only the current releases and rawhide (Fedora's developer preview) can be selected here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Severity, Hardware, and OS: can be filled or ignored. The developers usually use these if required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summary: A short summary of the issue, for example &amp;quot;Firefox crashes on start&amp;quot;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The template in the description requires a little more explanation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://ankursinha.in/images/20170516-bugzilla-description.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="The description of a bug." class="text-center img-responsive pagination-centered" src="http://ankursinha.in/images/20170516-bugzilla-description.png" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Description of the problem: A clear description of the problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Version-Release number of selected component: once the package name is known using the Fedora packages web application, the current version that is in use can be found using the rpm command in a terminal/console:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre class="code bash literal-block"&gt;
$ rpm -q &amp;lt;packagename&amp;gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# for example
&lt;/span&gt;$ rpm -q firefox
firefox-53.0-2.fc26.x86_64
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is important information, so that the developers know exactly what version of the source code this bug is present in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How reproducible: This is usually one of ALWAYS/SOMETIMES.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steps to reproduce: What actions does the user have to do to see the issue? In as much detail as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actual results: A description of exactly what happens - what is the issue - again, in as much detail as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expected result: What does the user expect should happen?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea here is to inform the developers if the issue happens all the time, or only sometimes erratically. When developers ask if a bug can be &amp;quot;reproduced&amp;quot;, what they're asking is if the issue can be ALWAYS seen when the user does certain actions. For example, if Firefox ALWAYS crashes, one would simply say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How reproducible: ALWAYS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steps to reproduce:
- Start Firefox from applications menu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actual results: Firefox does not start, it crashes immediately&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expected results: Firefox should start normally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more detailed the &amp;quot;steps to reproduce&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;actual results&amp;quot; are, the easier it is for developers to &amp;quot;debug&amp;quot; the issue. This is because, once they can pin point the exact problem, they can start using various tools to pin point where in the source code the problem arises from. Only then can developers think about fixing the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's quite it. If required, files can also be attached to the bug report. For example, screenshots, or screen casts, or error messages, and so on. After filling in the form, clicking the &amp;quot;Submit&amp;quot; button submits the report, and a developer will be informed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="ask-when-unsure"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Ask when unsure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often run into issues where I do not know what the right information to provide is. In such cases, I try to mention whatever I have and then request the maintainer to give me instructions on how I can provide more information to help. As an example, I recently hit a bug in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/"&gt;open source nouveau Nvidia driver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1439890#c12"&gt;asked the developer how I could collect more information&lt;/a&gt;. Sure enough, the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1439890#c13"&gt;developer was kind enough to give me some hints&lt;/a&gt;, and I managed to collect more information to help out. (I even learned a new kernel debugging tool in the process - &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/netconsole.txt"&gt;netconsole&lt;/a&gt;. Do you know what it is?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is absolutely nothing wrong with asking for help - anywhere in the community. When in doubt, ask!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="follow-up"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Follow up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the bug has been filed, the developer will look at the information that has been provided and begin to diagnose the issue. This is an iterative process. The developer may ask for more information, or may provide new versions of the application to test. In all of these cases, the developer will comment on the Bugzilla ticket, and everyone concerned with the bug will receive an e-mail notification. Following up on a bug report is important. It helps developers identify issues quickly, and of course, it helps them confirm fixes too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion-take-away-from-it-all"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion: take away from it all&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it's software and it can have issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cribbing, whining, blowing one's top off doesn't achieve much - not helping anyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;update your system regularly - it's important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;file a bug - you're helping!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;file a bug the right way - you're helping even more!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;follow up after you file the bug to aid the developer fix the issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rejoice with better, safer software!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/fedorahosted-sunset-2017-02-28/"&gt;Fedorahosted closed down at the end of last month&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FreeMedia"&gt;Free Media&lt;/a&gt; has quite a few components and we haven't been able to migrate the pipeline to Pagure completely yet. In fact, we've temporarily closed &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FreeMedia"&gt;Free Media&lt;/a&gt; down for the moment - the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/freemedia/FreeMedia-form.html"&gt;form&lt;/a&gt; says so too. Since we're re-doing the complete process and the infrastructure, we also decided to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/Free-Media/Housekeeping/issue/7"&gt;refresh the membership list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd e-mailed the mailing list and all members of the FAS informing them of this already. I've now gone ahead and cleared up the FAS group and the mailing list. In the new Pagure based workflow, this is the process to join the team:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/Free-Media/Housekeeping/new_issue"&gt;File a ticket&lt;/a&gt; at the Housekeeping Pagure instance with [membership-request] in the title&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the ticket, please mention:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your FAS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A link to your Fedora User wiki page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The e-mail address you'd like to subscribe to the mailing list with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An admin will accept the ticket, verify the information, and add you to the FAS group, Pagure group, and the mailing list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of work still to do before we can complete the migration and re-enable the Free Media programme. If you'd like to help out, please take a look at the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/Free-Media/Housekeeping/issues"&gt;open issues on the Housekeeping Pagure instance&lt;/a&gt;, or of course, get in touch with me. :)&lt;/p&gt;

Here's a quick update on what's going on and where you can help.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FreeMedia"&gt;Fedora Free Media programme&lt;/a&gt; aims to provide Fedora media to users in regions of the world where the internet connectivity is insufficient. The volunteers of this team download, burn, and mail out media from their own money. This is an imperative initiative that helps spread Free software to regions that are yet to catch up when it comes to infrastructure. When I'd checked last, we had about 250 volunteers in total - not all of them are active, of course, but that's the number I've been able to generate from querying FAS and the mailing list for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-setup"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The programme uses a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://fedoraproject.org/freemedia/FreeMedia-form.html"&gt;form&lt;/a&gt; that users fill to request media. This form is a frontend that files a ticket on our &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fedorahosted.org/freemedia/"&gt;trac instance&lt;/a&gt;. Volunteers then accept tickets and send out requests, closing the tickets when they do. Tickets that have not been serviced are regularly closed as &amp;quot;WONTFIX&amp;quot;. We send out an e-mail to the filer simply saying that since we've received too many requests, we've been unable to service them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-migration-to-pagure"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The migration to Pagure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Fedorahosted will soon be shut down, we need to move our repository to Pagure. We're going to use this opportunity to revitalise the project. There's a tracker issue here on the Pagure repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/pagure/issue/1223"&gt;https://pagure.io/pagure/issue/1223&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/Free-Media/Housekeeping/issue/1"&gt;https://pagure.io/Free-Media/Housekeeping/issue/1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="group-membership-refresh"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Group membership refresh&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/Free-Media/Housekeeping/issue/7"&gt;https://pagure.io/Free-Media/Housekeeping/issue/7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/Free-Media/Housekeeping/issue/6"&gt;https://pagure.io/Free-Media/Housekeeping/issue/6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike most teams where having inactive accounts doesn't affect the functioning of the group too much, it does tend to affect the Free Media team. This is because we really do need active members to be able to handle the load. Another issue here is privacy - only group members have access to the tickets, since the tickets contain the filers' addresses. So, ideally, only the smallest number of people needed must have access to these tickets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea we're floating is that we'll clean the group and the mailing list up, and invite existing users to re-join the team. Ones that volunteer will be added back. Please note that it is mandatory for each volunteer to have a Fedora user page, and every group member must also be subscribed to the mailing list so that they can be easily contacted when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="new-repository-setup"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;New repository setup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/Free-Media/Housekeeping/issue/9"&gt;https://pagure.io/Free-Media/Housekeeping/issue/9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can either have one repository that handles all tickets, or we can make it more modular and have a few repositories that handle tickets for various regions. Multiple repositories will need more work to do with the scripts and the frontend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="update-form-to-work-with-pagure-based-on-our-new-setup"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Update form to work with Pagure based on our new setup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/Free-Media/Housekeeping/issue/11"&gt;https://pagure.io/Free-Media/Housekeeping/issue/11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The form obviously needs to be updated to file tickets to the Pagure repository now. We have a new form that's much nicer, but it does need work before it can be deployed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="translate-form"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Translate form&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/Free-Media/Housekeeping/issue/10"&gt;https://pagure.io/Free-Media/Housekeeping/issue/10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It'll be even nicer if we can translate the form to make it more accessible to the different regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="use-updated-liveisos-instead-of-release-images"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Use updated liveisos instead of release images&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/Free-Media/Housekeeping/issue/8"&gt;https://pagure.io/Free-Media/Housekeeping/issue/8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the entire point of the programme is to serve users with limited internet connectivity, some of us feel there is little point in providing them release media that then must be udpated. The community already generates &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/alt/live-respins/"&gt;updated media&lt;/a&gt;, and we'd like to use these instead. We'd also like to help maintain the updated media by mirroring/seeding the sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this also brings up the age old question of migrating to USB sticks. I don't think they're still cheap enough for the Free Media programme to send out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="metrics"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Metrics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/Free-Media/Housekeeping/issue/5"&gt;https://pagure.io/Free-Media/Housekeeping/issue/5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to put scripts in place that will generate metrics for us at regular intervals - monthly maybe. This would really help gauge the work of the programme, and in turn, help us improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="so-yeah"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So, yeah!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's quite a lot of work to be done, as you can see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/Free-Media/Housekeeping/issue/14"&gt;trying to ascertain if it's all worth it to begin with - are we servicing enough tickets, and do we have a sufficiently large team that can continue to do so&lt;/a&gt;? Is the Free Media programme useful? The only way we'll know is if we check the recent metrics, and, of course, we'd like to hear what the community thinks. I think the programme is quite useful. When I was back in India, I'd send out media every month, and I'd usually get a very nice e-mail from the ticket owner telling me how much they appreciated the media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Free Media programme runs in isolation to the rest of the community, and we'd also like to change this. We want to see if we can have contributors from each region that also serve on the Fedora Ambassadors team - it'll help both teams keep up with each other to begin with, and it'll ensure that the Free Media team is not lost in the community. In order to make it a sustainable service, we need a constant influx of contributors to replace ones that leave or move and cannot contribute any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to help out, please drop a comment on the tickets, or file a new one, or e-mail me, or drop a comment on this post, or catch me on IRC!&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We had another constructive &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_Join_SIG"&gt;Fedora Join SIG&lt;/a&gt; meeting to kick off the new year. We're now working on what I refer to as &amp;quot;Stage 2&amp;quot;: improve the visibility of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_Join_SIG"&gt;Fedora Join SIG&lt;/a&gt; outside the community so that newcomers may easily find us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd sent out an &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/fedora-join&amp;#64;lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LSNTO76WGBICKWEZKQGYDJBXFSZNIX6A/"&gt;e-mail with ideas to the mailing list to set the meeting up&lt;/a&gt;. Based on the comments from the thread, we put a list of things together that need to now be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="resurrect-the-classroom-programme"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Resurrect the classroom programme&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/fedora-join/Fedora-Join/issue/22"&gt;https://pagure.io/fedora-join/Fedora-Join/issue/22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used to have &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Classroom"&gt;regular classroom sessions&lt;/a&gt; a few years ago. These were incredibly helpful for community members that were looking to pick up new skills. In fact, I began my contributions to Fedora via a classroom session on packaging years ago! We'd really like to get these restarted. If you have some ideas or would like to help organise these, please comment on the ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="ressurect-the-mentoring-programme"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ressurect the mentoring programme&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/fedora-join/Fedora-Join/issue/18"&gt;https://pagure.io/fedora-join/Fedora-Join/issue/18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also had a mentoring system in place long ago and we'd like to resurrect it to aid newbies looking to join Fedora. It's quite useful to have a seasoned community member to turn to when one gets stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to help out with mentoring, please comment on the ticket. We're already looking to set it up in a way such that it's more sustainable - any suggestions and feedback here would be most helpful too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="propose-stage-2-to-the-fedora-council-as-a-project-level-objective"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Propose stage 2 to the Fedora Council as a project-level objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/fedora-join/Fedora-Join/issue/19"&gt;https://pagure.io/fedora-join/Fedora-Join/issue/19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Mattdm"&gt;Mattdm&lt;/a&gt; suggested we could propose Stage 2 to the council as a project level objective. This would make the entire process get a lot more visibility in and outside the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Help is always welcome, of course. More information is available on the ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="fedora-public-facing-web-space-audit"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fedora public facing web space audit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/fedora-join/Fedora-Join/issue/21"&gt;https://pagure.io/fedora-join/Fedora-Join/issue/21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim here is to go through the Fedora websites and identify what the entry points for newbies maybe. We can then add information about Fedora Join to these pages to make it easier for them to find us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We requested some folks from the websites and design teams to help us here, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Duffy"&gt;Mo&lt;/a&gt;'s been brilliant as usual to drop a detailed comment on how one should go about this audit. If you have the time, please help us out here. It isn't a technical task at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="there-s-more"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;There's more&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot more happening - please take a look at both the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/fedora-commops/"&gt;CommOps&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/fedora-join/Fedora-Join/issues"&gt;Join issue&lt;/a&gt; lists. You can always contact us on the IRC channel or the mailing list. You can always e-mail me at &lt;cite&gt;ankursinha AT fedoraproject DOT org&lt;/cite&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
