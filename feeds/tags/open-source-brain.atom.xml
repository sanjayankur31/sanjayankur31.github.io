&lt;h2&gt;Internet woes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our internet connection went down last week, and was supposed to by Tuesday.
They said it was an issue at the &amp;quot;exchange&amp;quot; and that they didn't need to access our home to fix it.
Get to Monday, and I get a call from the engineer at work saying it was issue with the local fibre cabinet and that they need to tinker with our connection to the router to figure out what had gone wrong.
So, I dropped everything and rushed home (as you do, if you want internet access at home).
It took them an hour or so, but they did manage to fix it.
So we're back online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="neuroml-related"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NeuroML related&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://neuroml.org"&gt;NeuroML&lt;/a&gt; is a standard and software ecosystem for biophysically detailed neuronal modelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="gsoc"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;GSoC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work continues on this front.
Both Aditya and Ioannis already have pull requests open, so I've been reviewing them and providing feedback.
We're making sure we follow best practices right from the start---so doc strings, unit tests, type hints are all already in use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also added coverage information to our &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/NeuroML/pyNeuroML"&gt;pyNeuroML&lt;/a&gt; CI.
It doesn't use a third party service like Coveralls/Codecov/Codespace at the moment.
It's a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/NeuroML/pyNeuroML/blob/development/.github/workflows/ci.yml#L56"&gt;combination of two GitHub actions&lt;/a&gt;---one summarises the coverage that we generate using pytest-cov, and the other comments on the pull request.
It works well enough.
The commenter action replaces to same comment each time too, so it doesn't spam the pull request with repeated comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has pointed out that some of our code needs more testing, so we've put that on our agenda too now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="model-conversion"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Model conversion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued to work on converting the Purkinje cell model from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(18)31088-X"&gt;Zang et al&lt;/a&gt;.
Using my test script, I've converted another couple of channels.
While converting the &amp;quot;Large conductance Ca2+ activated K+ channel&amp;quot; (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sanjayankur31/243446/blob/feat/neuroml-conversion/NeuroML2/mod/mslo.mod"&gt;mslo.mod&lt;/a&gt;), I was reminded of this excellent features of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.neuroml.org/Userdocs/LEMS.html"&gt;LEMS&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LEMS is unit and dimension aware: one does not have to worry about units while writing equations, one can use whatever units one wishes and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.neuroml.org/Userdocs/LEMS.html"&gt;LEMS&lt;/a&gt; will convert them to the right multipliers depending on the dimensions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for example, even if a model component provides the temperature value in degrees C, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.neuroml.org/Userdocs/LEMS.html"&gt;LEMS&lt;/a&gt; will convert this into Kelvin when it's being used somewhere.
Here's how it needs to be explicitly converted in the mod file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;
alpha = exp(Qo*FARADAY*v/R/(273.15 + celsius))
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's how the corresponding LEMS looks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code xml literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;DerivedVariable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;alpha_beta&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;dimension=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;none&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;value=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;exp((Qo_Qc * Faraday * v/R) / EXP_TEMP_CELSIUS)&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The variable names have been tweaked so that the same derived variable can also be used for other calculations that follow the same formalism)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the plots for the kinetic state variables for the NEURON and NeuroML conversions for a simple protocol where we:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create a simple single compartmental cell, with only a soma&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add the ion channel to it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add the minimal biophysics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use a &amp;quot;Calcium clamp&amp;quot; to set the intra- and extra-cellular calcium concentrations to some values for a part of the simulation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then record all the states and plot them to see how our conversion went.
You'll see that they match almost exactly, which is always a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Values of kinetic state variables from a test simulation of the original implementation in NEURON." class="text-center img-responsive pagination-centered" src="https://ankursinha.in/images/20240612143718_test_mslo_states_NEURON.png" style="width: 60%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Values of kinetic state variables from a test simulation of the original implementation in NEURON.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Values of kinetic state variables from a test simulation of the NeuroML conversion." class="text-center img-responsive pagination-centered" src="https://ankursinha.in/images/20240612143718_test_kmslo_states_NML.png" style="width: 60%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Values of kinetic state variables from a test simulation of the NeuroML conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two more channels left to convert.
These are of a third type---they use the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman%E2%80%93Hodgkin%E2%80%93Katz_flux_equation"&gt;&amp;quot;GHK&amp;quot; (Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz) equation&lt;/a&gt;.
I'll work on converting them next.
Then, we need to place these on the cell morphology to verify that the NEURON implementation and our standardised &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://neuroml.org"&gt;NeuroML&lt;/a&gt; implementation show the same dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="fedora-related"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fedora related&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixes, updates, and bug filing continues in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org"&gt;NeuroFedora SIG&lt;/a&gt;.
The internet chaos coincided with our NeuroSIG meeting time though, so I had to cancel that this week.
We will meet again in two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last Monday was the late spring bank holiday, so it was a four day week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="neuroml-related"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NeuroML related&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="NeuroML is a standard and software ecosystem for biophysically detailed neuronal modelling." class="text-center img-responsive pagination-centered" src="https://ankursinha.in/images/neuroml-logo.png" style="width: 40%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://neuroml.org"&gt;NeuroML&lt;/a&gt; is a standard and software ecosystem for biophysically detailed neuronal modelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've made some changes to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/NeuroML/NeuroML2/commit/fe3aa27d2ed146938be3efa19dfb15ddd8cc3804"&gt;NeuroML standard&lt;/a&gt; in the last week.
For neuron models, a few basic properties were optional so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.neuroml.org/Userdocs/Schemas/Cells.html#spikethresh"&gt;spiking threshold potential&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.neuroml.org/Userdocs/Schemas/Cells.html#specificcapacitance"&gt;specific capacitance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.neuroml.org/Userdocs/Schemas/Cells.html#initmembpotential"&gt;initial membrane potential&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/"&gt;NEURON&lt;/a&gt; simulator, which is sort of the reference simulator for computational neuro-modelling, would use sane defaults if these values were not provided by the user.
However, since other simulators that &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.neuroml.org/Userdocs/Software/SupportingTools.html"&gt;NeuroML supports&lt;/a&gt; may not fill in defaults, we decided that these properties should also be compulsory for the user to provide explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Updating the standard requires a few steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;update the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.neuroml.org/Userdocs/NeuroMLv2.html"&gt;XSD schema&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;regenerate the various APIs, e.g., &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/libNeuroML"&gt;libNeuroML&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;run tests on all our models to see how many break with this backwards-incompatible change and fix them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fall out doesn't seem too bad, and we've fixed the few models that needed fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="toggling-build-time-validation-in-libneuroml"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Toggling build time validation in libNeuroML&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the strengths of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://neuroml.org"&gt;NeuroML&lt;/a&gt; standard is that we have a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.neuroml.org/Userdocs/Specification.html"&gt;schema&lt;/a&gt; that allows the validation of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://neuroml.org"&gt;NeuroML&lt;/a&gt; model descriptions---before the models have been initialised/instantiated/simulated.
Using our &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://libneuroml.readthedocs.io/en/development/userdocs/utils.html#neuroml.utils.component_factory"&gt;factory functions&lt;/a&gt;, the model is continuously validated at each construction/build step.
While this is useful, it can also be a hindrance to users in some cases.
For example, certain model components, in general usage, will not be valid when initially created.
A &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.neuroml.org/Userdocs/Schemas/Networks.html#network"&gt;Network&lt;/a&gt; component is one such example.
It must contain at least one &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.neuroml.org/Userdocs/Schemas/Networks.html#population"&gt;Population&lt;/a&gt;.
However, in normal usage, one generally creates a network and then adds populations to it.
So, when the network is initially created, it will be invalid.
In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/libNeuroML"&gt;libNeuroML&lt;/a&gt;, validation errors will throw a &lt;code&gt;ValueError&lt;/code&gt; immediately to inform the user, and halting the Python script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other such cases too, and we thought this conflicts with our goal of making it easier for users to create &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://neuroml.org"&gt;NeuroML&lt;/a&gt; models.
A middle-ground that &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/libNeuroML/pull/190"&gt;we've come up with&lt;/a&gt; is the ability to globally toggle the state of build time validation.
By default, it's enabled, but users may disable it if required---explicitly.
Additionally, build time validation can also be disabled for the specific call to the factory function using &lt;code&gt;validate=False&lt;/code&gt;.
The latter is recommended.
When build time validation is disabled, it will throw a user warning instead of the &lt;code&gt;ValueError&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="completing-the-spike-plotting-bits"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Completing the spike plotting bits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aditya &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/NeuroML/pyNeuroML/issues/303"&gt;was working&lt;/a&gt; on refactoring the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/NeuroML/pyNeuroML"&gt;pyNeuroML&lt;/a&gt; code that plots spikes from simulation output.
He completed his PR and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/NeuroML/pyNeuroML/pull/377"&gt;I merged it after making a few tweaks to the tests&lt;/a&gt;.
One can now easily plot spikes from data files using the &lt;code&gt;pynml-plotspikes&lt;/code&gt; command, and also using the related functions in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/NeuroML/pyNeuroML"&gt;pyNeuroML&lt;/a&gt; API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's an example of plotting spikes from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/Brunel2000/"&gt;Brunel et al (2000)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code console literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;pynml-plotspikes&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-format&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;t_id&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;*_net.spikes
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Raster plot showing spikes from a simulation of `Brunel et al (2000) &amp;lt;https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/Brunel2000/&amp;gt;`__." class="text-center img-responsive pagination-centered" src="https://ankursinha.in/images/20240603-Brunel2000-spikes.png" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="gsoc"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;GSoC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had our first meeting of the contribution period last week.
Both candidates, Aditya and Ioannis, are already set up and well on their way.
Ioannis is continuing with the task that he had begun working on during the contribution period already---trying to get an &amp;quot;upright&amp;quot; view of single neurons in our 3D visualiser.
Aditya has started working on loading SWC files of neuronal reconstructions into an appropriate data structure that will make it easy to query the SWC morphology and validate it, and then eventually convert it into NeuroML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="other-stuff"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other stuff&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued to work on converting the Purkinje cell model from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(18)31088-X"&gt;Zang et al&lt;/a&gt;.
I now have a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sanjayankur31/243446/blob/feat/neuroml-conversion/NeuroML2/testks.py"&gt;test scripts that plots the various state variables&lt;/a&gt; from the ion channels represented using kinetic schemes.
It adds the ion channel to a single compartmental cell, gives it a constant current to bring the state variables to their steady states, and plots these.
It does this both for the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/"&gt;NEURON&lt;/a&gt; implementation and the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://neuroml.org"&gt;NeuroML&lt;/a&gt; one so that I can compare the dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="fedora-related"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fedora related&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixes, updates, and bug filing continues in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org"&gt;NeuroFedora SIG&lt;/a&gt;.
It's ticking along nicely, as it tends to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;GSoC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our two GSoC candidates continue to make tweaks to their work.
This is still only the bonding period, so they're already ahead of time.
The contribution period only started this week, on the 27th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also had our weekly meeting where we discussed their tasks and concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Open Source Brain related&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/OSBv2/pull/928"&gt;integrating Biomodels into OSBv2&lt;/a&gt;.
Here's a video of what it'll look like, tested out on my local Minikube deployment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Other work related bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="trainings"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Trainings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had two trainings to do this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first was &amp;quot;Deaf Awareness: working and communicating well with Deaf people&amp;quot;.
It was very very useful.
I certainly learned a lot of things that I wasn't aware of, or that I hadn't thought of before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other training was related to hiring.
This one is a compulsory training required for all staff that are going to be on interview panels for new staff.
It points out various things one should know to ensure the hiring process is carried out fairly and correctly, within the framework of the law.
It was also very informative, and having an insight into the frameworks that the university implements was very useful too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="departmental-away-day"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Departmental away day&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had our departmental away day on Friday.
Lots of discussion about our research, our teaching, on how we fit in within the larger picture with the university.
I spoke to our dean and other principal investigators (PIs) in the department and offered to help on things here and there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a barbecue in the evening with drinks, and a few of us continued to the pub afterwords to keep the discussion going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="fedora-related"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fedora related&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More package updates on the Fedora side of things.
The NeuroFedora SIG will have its meeting next Monday.
We'll all catch up then to see if there are things that need prioritising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="other-stuff"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other stuff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lost my tabs the other day.
I was tinkering with my &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://qutebrowser.org"&gt;Qutebrowser&lt;/a&gt; configuration, and I opened the browser but saved the session and quit it before all the tabs had loaded.
This meant that the next time I opened it, all the tabs were completely blank.
Bug?
Not really---I needed to either have waited for the session to load, or I should've quit without saving a partially loaded session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The silver lining is that I've closed 100 tabs with research papers that I'd had open for the past year but not managed to read.
So, a clear up of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="returned-sony-earbuds"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Returned Sony earbuds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd bought myself a set of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.sony.co.uk/headphones/products/wf-c700n"&gt;WF-C700N&lt;/a&gt; ear buds some time ago.
I'd seen a few reviews.
They won the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.whathifi.com/reviews/sony-wf-c700n"&gt;What Hi-Fi award in 2023&lt;/a&gt;, so they seemed a good buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're very good sound wise for their price, but unfortunately, they turned out to be very buggy.
The right ear bud would just not turn on a lot of the time.
The docs suggested re-initialising them to fix the issue, and while it did fix the issue for a bit, the right earbud would go off again and not turn back on.
I did this a few times, but it became increasingly annoying.
Heading out on my commute only to find that the right earbud had stopped working again was really not fun.
On top of that, I couldn't reliably re-initialise them each time.
Sometimes the reinitialising process wouldn't work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A search showed me that lots of users were experiencing this, with multiple &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyHeadphones/comments/16xxpvj/right_earbud_randomly_stops_turning_on_wfc700n/"&gt;folks on Reddit confirming the issue&lt;/a&gt; and suggesting returning the earbuds.
I persevered and tried various things on my Android phone too, but in the end nothing really fixed the issue.
So, I've returned them too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shelled out a bit more and got the top of the line &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.sony.co.uk/headphones/products/wf-1000xm5"&gt;WF-1000XM5&lt;/a&gt; ones now.
They're double the price, and have much better sound quality and a few more features.
So far, so good 🤞.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;NeuroML related&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="NeuroML is a standard and software ecosystem for biophysically detailed neuronal modelling." class="text-center img-responsive pagination-centered" src="https://ankursinha.in/images/neuroml-logo.png" style="width: 40%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://neuroml.org"&gt;NeuroML&lt;/a&gt; is a standard and software ecosystem for biophysically detailed neuronal modelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work continues on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/NeuroML/pyNeuroML"&gt;pyNeuroML&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="animations-and-saving-them"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Animations, and saving them&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/NeuroML/pyNeuroML/pull/348"&gt;YBCS improved our plotting code to allow creation and saving of animations&lt;/a&gt;, using &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/animations/animations.html"&gt;Matplotlib&lt;/a&gt;. This is useful for analysis, and also for dissemination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for instance, one can generate this animation from our &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.neuroml.org/Userdocs/SingleNeuronExample.html#"&gt;single izhikevich neuron documentation example&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="An animated GIF showing the membrane potential of a regular spiking Izhikevich neuron." class="img-responsive" src="https://ankursinha.in/images/20240520-izhikevich-animation-loop.gif" style="width: 40%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;An animated GIF showing the membrane potential of a regular spiking Izhikevich neuron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's an example script that reads in the data generated by our example and saves the animation in a GIF file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code python literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="ch"&gt;#!/usr/bin/env python3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pyneuroml.plot&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;generate_plot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pyneuroml.runners&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;reload_saved_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;reload_saved_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;./LEMS_example-single-izhikevich2007cell-sim.xml&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;generate_plot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'t'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'IzhPop0[0]/v'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;animate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;              &lt;span class="n"&gt;save_figure_to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;izhikevich.gif&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Membrane potential&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generating the animation doesn't take so much time, but saving it does.
From what I've managed to find (for example, on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/13561/"&gt;this ticket&lt;/a&gt;), saving of the animation relies on piping it to external tools (&amp;quot;animation writers&amp;quot;), and that bit seems to take time.
We use a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://progressbar-2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;progressbar&lt;/a&gt; to provide some feedback to the user, so they have some idea of how long to expect it to take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code console literal-block"&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="using-vispy-visualisations-in-jupyter-notebooks"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Using Vispy visualisations in Jupyter notebooks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://vispy.org"&gt;Vispy&lt;/a&gt; visualisations can also work in Jupyter notebooks using &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/vispy/jupyter_rfb"&gt;jupyter_rfb&lt;/a&gt;.
It'll be very good for us to make this work for our visualisations too, so that users can view their cells and networks in 3D in their notebooks.
I tinkered with it a bit but could not get jupyter_rfb to work for me.
I filed a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/vispy/jupyter_rfb/issues/89"&gt;bug&lt;/a&gt; upstream, and it was quickly fixed.
I now need to continue playing with it to see what changes, if any, we need to make to our code to make our visualisations work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="google-summer-of-code"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Google Summer of Code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had our first meeting with our two GSoC interns.
It's still only the community bonding period, so they're just tinkering with the code and reading the documentation to get a feel for how things work.
They've both already been working on pull requests, so they're already ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was really good to have a chat with them.
We talked about what they hope to get out of the internship and so on, so that we can tweak the tasks to ensure that the internship benefits them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="model-standardization"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Model standardization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued to work on converting the Purkinje cell model from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(18)31088-X"&gt;Zang et al&lt;/a&gt;.
I'm still working on the biophysics.
There are a few ion channels where the dynamics are described in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.neuroml.org/Userdocs/Schemas/Channels.html#schema-gateks"&gt;kinetic state&lt;/a&gt; formalism that one has to convert manually.
Analysing these to verify that they've been converted correctly is hard too, because unlike ion channels that follow the standard Hodgkin-Huxley formalism, the gates in the Kinetic State ion channels don't have their steady state and decay time constants directly available.
So, we're going to have to simulate a passive cell with a single Kinetic State ion channel, both for the original NEURON implementation of the ion channel and for our NeuroML conversion, and then we'll compare the various generated biophysics (and iteratively tweak our conversion until they match).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="open-source-brain"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Open Source Brain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Source Brain (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.opensourcebrain.org/"&gt;OSB&lt;/a&gt;) is a web platform for neuroscientists.
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://v1.opensourcebrain.org"&gt;Version 1&lt;/a&gt; was focussed on the sharing and archival of biophysically detailed models, standardised in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://neuroml.org"&gt;NeuroML&lt;/a&gt;.
There are a number of published models on the platform that one can visualise and study there already:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="A screenshot of Open Source Brain version 1." class="text-center img-responsive pagination-centered" src="https://ankursinha.in/images/20240520-osbv1.png" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;A screenshot of Open Source Brain version 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newer version, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://v2.opensourcebrain.org"&gt;version 2&lt;/a&gt; takes it a step further.
Its goal is to be a cloud based integrated research environment where people can store their data and their code in &amp;quot;workspaces&amp;quot;, and work in the cloud, requesting as many resources as they need.
This means that people no longer have to set up their own computers/lab servers---the platform will provide the computing infrastructure and the required tools in a web browser.
OSBv2 also indexes a number of data sources to make it easier for researchers to find data and models, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.dandiarchive.org"&gt;DANDI archive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://modeldb.science"&gt;Model-DB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="A screenshot of Open Source Brain version 2." class="text-center img-responsive pagination-centered" src="https://ankursinha.in/images/20240520-osbv2.png" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;A screenshot of Open Source Brain version 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OSBv2 also integrates a number of web applications for users:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NetPyNE-UI: an interface for the popular &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://netpyne.org"&gt;NetPyNE&lt;/a&gt; model building library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NWB Explorer: an interface for visualising &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://nwb.org"&gt;Neurodata Without Borders (NWB)&lt;/a&gt; files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://jupyter.org"&gt;Jupyter Lab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're working on integrating &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://biosimulations.org"&gt;biosimulations.org&lt;/a&gt; as another data source now.
This requires adding an adapter to the back end that understands the biosimulations.org API so that it can use it to pull information from there to index.
An initial version has already been implemented.
We now need to test it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="osbv2-dev-environment"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;OSBv2: dev environment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since OSBv2 is cloud based (currently deployed on Google Cloud), it makes use of containers and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/"&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; (our software partners, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://metacell.us"&gt;MetaCell&lt;/a&gt; manage our infrastructure and a majority of the development/maintenance of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.opensourcebrain.org/"&gt;OSB&lt;/a&gt;).
The complete platform is also broken down into a number of services.
To test changes and develop, therefore, one has to run a local deployment.
We've documented the steps in our &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/OSBv2/blob/master/README.md"&gt;readme&lt;/a&gt;, and I've got &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sanjayankur31/100_dotfiles/blob/main/bin/deploy-osbv2.sh"&gt;a script&lt;/a&gt; to automate the various steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it's never that simple.
While my script had worked the last time I had tinkered with OSBv2, it didn't work last week and I spent hours trying to figure out why.
I need to continue with that this week too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="software-working-group"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Software Working Group&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://ocns.github.io/SoftwareWG/index.html"&gt;Software Working Group&lt;/a&gt; is an open community working group about all things software.
It's shared by the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://incf.org"&gt;International Neuroinformatics Co-ordinating Facility&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.cnsorg.org"&gt;Organization for Computational Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;.
The idea is simply to have a community for exchange of ideas related to research/neuroscience software development.
The working group is based on GitHub, and open to anyone at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, we had &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://ocns.github.io/SoftwareWG/2024/05/07/wg-meeting-14-may-2024-spikeinterface-pierre-yger-.html"&gt;a session on SpikeInterface where Pierre Yger presented the tool to the community&lt;/a&gt;.
It was recorded, and the recordings should be on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/&amp;#64;IncfOrg_INCF"&gt;INCF YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="fedora"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fedora&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked on a few &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://packager-dashboard.fedoraproject.org/dashboard?groups=neuro-sig"&gt;Neuro SIG&lt;/a&gt; packages--updates, Fails to Build From Source (FTBFS) issues, and so on.
Not much to report in detail here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;I seem to be getting busier every day, and the only way I can seem to be able
to do all the work I want to is by staying extremely organised. An important
part of organisation is being able to look back at the work that was done, and
whether it could be done better---perhaps prioritised better---to make it all a
little more efficient. So, given that I haven't been blogging frequently over
the last year, I am trying to track the time I spend working more religiously
and write a short weekly work report. It gives me the chance to review the past
week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in the weeks leading up to today, 4th April, this is what I have been up
to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="dissertation-writing"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dissertation writing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm working on writing up my dissertation, at the end of my PhD now. I've made
good progress. I have another chapter or so to go before I should be able to
submit. My supervision team has been reviewing and editing individual chapters
as I finish them. We are already working on a paper, and the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/10/21/810846"&gt;pre-print&lt;/a&gt; for this had gone
through multiple rounds of review. So the chapters that came from the paper
didn't need too much work. Another chapter is based on the reports I wrote for
my assessments (back in 2015!), but having it all written down also made it
easier to edit and add to the dissertation. I am extremely glad that my
supervision team got me to maintain a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sanjayankur31/calliope/issues"&gt;daily lab journal&lt;/a&gt;. It makes writing the
dissertation so much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="research-fellow-at-the-silver-lab-at-university-college-london"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Research fellow at the Silver Lab at University College London&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was fortunate enough to secure a research fellow job at the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://silverlab.org/"&gt;Silver Lab&lt;/a&gt;
while working on my dissertation. Generally, we PhD candidates submit our
dissertations and then spend a few months hunting for positions. From all
accounts, it's not meant to be an easy transition to a post-doc position. The
number of PhDs entering the job market easily outnumbers the number of
available research positions. So, I was also preparing for a few months of
unemployment---saving money primarily---while I hunted for positions after I
had submitted. In my case as an international migrant/expat/job stealer, my
employers would also have to sponsor my visa, and not all employers do that. If
I hadn't managed to find a position before my current student visa expired, I'd
have to return to India and continue applying from there. That makes it even
harder, and all the time one is not working on research, one is already falling
behind. So, transitioning on to a position while still writing up was a very
very lucky break for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research group does a lot of experimental work, but it is also where the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="opensourcebrain.org"&gt;Open Source Brain&lt;/a&gt; project is based. Given my computing background, and
experience with FOSS in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Ankursinha"&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt;, a large component of my
role is to work on the development of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="opensourcebrain.org"&gt;Open Source Brain&lt;/a&gt; platform, and liaise
with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://metacell.us/"&gt;MetaCell&lt;/a&gt; who do most of the core development. Along with that, I get to
work on modelling and other research projects. I was looking to work in a group
that included experimentalists. I think that it is important for me to develop
as an independent researcher in neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's early days yet. I am only two weeks in, so I am still settling down. Since
I am on a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.gov.uk/tier-4-general-visa"&gt;Tier 4 student visa&lt;/a&gt; at the moment, I can only work twenty hours a
week. That's about two days a week, and is really not enough to get a lot done,
especially given that it is meant to include the various meetings that I am to
attend. HR are working on getting me my Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) so
that I can apply to transition on to a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.gov.uk/tier-2-general"&gt;Tier 2 work visa&lt;/a&gt;. It is similar to the
Certificate of Acceptance of Studies (CAS) that international students must get
from their universities before they can apply for their &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.gov.uk/tier-4-general-visa"&gt;Tier 4 student visa&lt;/a&gt;.
Sponsoring organisations can sponsor a limited number of internationals each
year, so we're waiting for the new cycle to start this month in April when UCL
will be able to sponsor more of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the two weeks that I've been in, I've been learning the development process
that &lt;a class="reference external" href="opensourcebrain.org"&gt;Open Source Brain&lt;/a&gt; follows: attending sprint meetings, and the sort.
I'll write a post dedicated to this in a near future. It is on my to-do list.
This week, we &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/SilverLabUCL/docker-osq/pull/6"&gt;diagnosed and fixed&lt;/a&gt; an issue with the
current deployment. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sendmail"&gt;Sendmail&lt;/a&gt; was
blocking the server because the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docker.io"&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; container hadn't
a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FQDN"&gt;FQDN&lt;/a&gt; as its hostname. The things we
learn. If you do find any issues with the &lt;a class="reference external" href="opensourcebrain.org"&gt;Open Source Brain&lt;/a&gt; platform, please
file an issue (or e-mail me if you prefer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's more work to be done: the deployment is being moved off &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://aws.amazon.com/"&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt; on to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cloud.google.com/"&gt;Google Cloud Platform&lt;/a&gt;. It's simple enough, but of course, the
deployment needs to be tested and validated before it can be declared live and
the AWS instance torn down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also been learning how the research group works: getting to know the
people, what their interests are; attending the group discussions and journal
clubs; keeping an eye on various journals to share new science that may be
interesting to us. I've already learned quite a bit from the discussion. Given
the COVID situation, we're all working from home, so everything is happening
over Slack and video calls. I had managed to go to UCL for my induction in my
first week. I was the only one there for that particular session. Again, I was
lucky, since I expect that was the last induction session before UCL decided to
limit access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Fedora&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're nearing the Fedora 32 release, so I worked on the bits remaining for the
new &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Comp_Neuro_Lab"&gt;CompNeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; lab image.  Based on the discussion at the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://neuro.fedoraproject.org"&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt;
meeting, I &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/fedora-websites/issue/1010"&gt;passed all the information&lt;/a&gt; needed to set up a page for
the lab to the Websites team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general package updates continue. I just updated &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://briansimulator.org/"&gt;Brian2&lt;/a&gt; to the new version
this morning and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/?packages=python-brian2"&gt;pushed an update with a test case&lt;/a&gt;.  The test
case takes one through the tutorial, so if one is looking to learn how to use
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://briansimulator.org/"&gt;Brian2&lt;/a&gt;, this is a good way of doing it while contributing to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://neuro.fedoraproject.org"&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt;.
Another few bugs were fixed and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/users/ankursinha"&gt;updates pushed&lt;/a&gt; too. I've got to work on
packaging a few new tools that are on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issues?status=Open&amp;amp;assignee=ankursinha"&gt;list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/fedora-join/Welcome-to-Fedora"&gt;Fedora-Join&lt;/a&gt; front,
we've had a few more folks join the community to help out. It was lovely
chatting with new folks and discussing where and how they'd like to work with
the community. Needless to say, lots of cookie giving has occurred in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#fedora-join"&gt;IRC
channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also been thinking about the lack of a process for Community Changes in
Fedora. Why isn't there something similar to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/program_management/changes_policy/"&gt;Change process that we use
for dev changes&lt;/a&gt;? I
finally &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/tickets/issue/291"&gt;filed a ticket with the Council&lt;/a&gt;. It's being discussed
on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/council-discuss&amp;#64;lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/NT3JI4QIA7D2UJWCOV662FZHOV6BUBLJ/"&gt;council-discuss mailing list&lt;/a&gt;.
I've also asked &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/mindshare/issue/197"&gt;Mindshare&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/fedora-commops/issue/205"&gt;CommOps&lt;/a&gt; to weigh in this
morning. Please feel free to jump in and discuss how we should go about this. A
change process that
focusses on community is important, in my book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Git forge discussion continues on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel&amp;#64;lists.fedoraproject.org/"&gt;-devel mailing list&lt;/a&gt;,
so I've been keeping up with that. I would prefer Pagure myself, and I do
understand the CPE team's view even if I don't necessarily agree with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="organisation-for-computational-neuroscience-ocns"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Organisation for Computational Neuroscience: OCNS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things are quite quiet in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.cnsorg.org/"&gt;OCNS&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.cnsorg.org/board-of-directors"&gt;Board&lt;/a&gt; has been discussing how best to
handle the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.cnsorg.org/cns-2020"&gt;CNS*2020&lt;/a&gt; conference. An
announcement will be made once a decision has been reached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="review-comments"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Review comments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This turned out a lot longer than I'd expected. As I settle down to a weekly
post, it should get shorter. However, I do see that I've got lots going on, and
perhaps I do need to be more disciplined when accepting/volunteering for tasks,
and prioritising them once I've taken them up. I'm not &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.winglemeyer.org/ramblings/2019/01/07/cookie-cleanup.html"&gt;cookie-licking&lt;/a&gt; at
the moment, so that's quite good. Still, lots to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
