&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;I seem to be getting busier every day, and the only way I can seem to be able
to do all the work I want to is by staying extremely organised. An important
part of organisation is being able to look back at the work that was done, and
whether it could be done better---perhaps prioritised better---to make it all a
little more efficient. So, given that I haven't been blogging frequently over
the last year, I am trying to track the time I spend working more religiously
and write a short weekly work report. It gives me the chance to review the past
week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in the weeks leading up to today, 4th April, this is what I have been up
to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="dissertation-writing"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dissertation writing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm working on writing up my dissertation, at the end of my PhD now. I've made
good progress. I have another chapter or so to go before I should be able to
submit. My supervision team has been reviewing and editing individual chapters
as I finish them. We are already working on a paper, and the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/10/21/810846"&gt;pre-print&lt;/a&gt; for this had gone
through multiple rounds of review. So the chapters that came from the paper
didn't need too much work. Another chapter is based on the reports I wrote for
my assessments (back in 2015!), but having it all written down also made it
easier to edit and add to the dissertation. I am extremely glad that my
supervision team got me to maintain a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sanjayankur31/calliope/issues"&gt;daily lab journal&lt;/a&gt;. It makes writing the
dissertation so much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="research-fellow-at-the-silver-lab-at-university-college-london"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Research fellow at the Silver Lab at University College London&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was fortunate enough to secure a research fellow job at the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://silverlab.org/"&gt;Silver Lab&lt;/a&gt;
while working on my dissertation. Generally, we PhD candidates submit our
dissertations and then spend a few months hunting for positions. From all
accounts, it's not meant to be an easy transition to a post-doc position. The
number of PhDs entering the job market easily outnumbers the number of
available research positions. So, I was also preparing for a few months of
unemployment---saving money primarily---while I hunted for positions after I
had submitted. In my case as an international migrant/expat/job stealer, my
employers would also have to sponsor my visa, and not all employers do that. If
I hadn't managed to find a position before my current student visa expired, I'd
have to return to India and continue applying from there. That makes it even
harder, and all the time one is not working on research, one is already falling
behind. So, transitioning on to a position while still writing up was a very
very lucky break for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research group does a lot of experimental work, but it is also where the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="opensourcebrain.org"&gt;Open Source Brain&lt;/a&gt; project is based. Given my computing background, and
experience with FOSS in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Ankursinha"&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt;, a large component of my
role is to work on the development of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="opensourcebrain.org"&gt;Open Source Brain&lt;/a&gt; platform, and liaise
with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://metacell.us/"&gt;MetaCell&lt;/a&gt; who do most of the core development. Along with that, I get to
work on modelling and other research projects. I was looking to work in a group
that included experimentalists. I think that it is important for me to develop
as an independent researcher in neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's early days yet. I am only two weeks in, so I am still settling down. Since
I am on a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.gov.uk/tier-4-general-visa"&gt;Tier 4 student visa&lt;/a&gt; at the moment, I can only work twenty hours a
week. That's about two days a week, and is really not enough to get a lot done,
especially given that it is meant to include the various meetings that I am to
attend. HR are working on getting me my Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) so
that I can apply to transition on to a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.gov.uk/tier-2-general"&gt;Tier 2 work visa&lt;/a&gt;. It is similar to the
Certificate of Acceptance of Studies (CAS) that international students must get
from their universities before they can apply for their &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.gov.uk/tier-4-general-visa"&gt;Tier 4 student visa&lt;/a&gt;.
Sponsoring organisations can sponsor a limited number of internationals each
year, so we're waiting for the new cycle to start this month in April when UCL
will be able to sponsor more of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the two weeks that I've been in, I've been learning the development process
that &lt;a class="reference external" href="opensourcebrain.org"&gt;Open Source Brain&lt;/a&gt; follows: attending sprint meetings, and the sort.
I'll write a post dedicated to this in a near future. It is on my to-do list.
This week, we &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/SilverLabUCL/docker-osq/pull/6"&gt;diagnosed and fixed&lt;/a&gt; an issue with the
current deployment. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sendmail"&gt;Sendmail&lt;/a&gt; was
blocking the server because the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docker.io"&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; container hadn't
a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FQDN"&gt;FQDN&lt;/a&gt; as its hostname. The things we
learn. If you do find any issues with the &lt;a class="reference external" href="opensourcebrain.org"&gt;Open Source Brain&lt;/a&gt; platform, please
file an issue (or e-mail me if you prefer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's more work to be done: the deployment is being moved off &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://aws.amazon.com/"&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt; on to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cloud.google.com/"&gt;Google Cloud Platform&lt;/a&gt;. It's simple enough, but of course, the
deployment needs to be tested and validated before it can be declared live and
the AWS instance torn down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also been learning how the research group works: getting to know the
people, what their interests are; attending the group discussions and journal
clubs; keeping an eye on various journals to share new science that may be
interesting to us. I've already learned quite a bit from the discussion. Given
the COVID situation, we're all working from home, so everything is happening
over Slack and video calls. I had managed to go to UCL for my induction in my
first week. I was the only one there for that particular session. Again, I was
lucky, since I expect that was the last induction session before UCL decided to
limit access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="fedora"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fedora&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're nearing the Fedora 32 release, so I worked on the bits remaining for the
new &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Comp_Neuro_Lab"&gt;CompNeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; lab image.  Based on the discussion at the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://neuro.fedoraproject.org"&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt;
meeting, I &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/fedora-websites/issue/1010"&gt;passed all the information&lt;/a&gt; needed to set up a page for
the lab to the Websites team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general package updates continue. I just updated &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://briansimulator.org/"&gt;Brian2&lt;/a&gt; to the new version
this morning and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/?packages=python-brian2"&gt;pushed an update with a test case&lt;/a&gt;.  The test
case takes one through the tutorial, so if one is looking to learn how to use
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://briansimulator.org/"&gt;Brian2&lt;/a&gt;, this is a good way of doing it while contributing to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://neuro.fedoraproject.org"&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt;.
Another few bugs were fixed and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/users/ankursinha"&gt;updates pushed&lt;/a&gt; too. I've got to work on
packaging a few new tools that are on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issues?status=Open&amp;amp;assignee=ankursinha"&gt;list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/fedora-join/Welcome-to-Fedora"&gt;Fedora-Join&lt;/a&gt; front,
we've had a few more folks join the community to help out. It was lovely
chatting with new folks and discussing where and how they'd like to work with
the community. Needless to say, lots of cookie giving has occurred in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#fedora-join"&gt;IRC
channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also been thinking about the lack of a process for Community Changes in
Fedora. Why isn't there something similar to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/program_management/changes_policy/"&gt;Change process that we use
for dev changes&lt;/a&gt;? I
finally &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/tickets/issue/291"&gt;filed a ticket with the Council&lt;/a&gt;. It's being discussed
on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/council-discuss&amp;#64;lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/NT3JI4QIA7D2UJWCOV662FZHOV6BUBLJ/"&gt;council-discuss mailing list&lt;/a&gt;.
I've also asked &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/mindshare/issue/197"&gt;Mindshare&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/fedora-commops/issue/205"&gt;CommOps&lt;/a&gt; to weigh in this
morning. Please feel free to jump in and discuss how we should go about this. A
change process that
focusses on community is important, in my book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Git forge discussion continues on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel&amp;#64;lists.fedoraproject.org/"&gt;-devel mailing list&lt;/a&gt;,
so I've been keeping up with that. I would prefer Pagure myself, and I do
understand the CPE team's view even if I don't necessarily agree with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="organisation-for-computational-neuroscience-ocns"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Organisation for Computational Neuroscience: OCNS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things are quite quiet in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.cnsorg.org/"&gt;OCNS&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.cnsorg.org/board-of-directors"&gt;Board&lt;/a&gt; has been discussing how best to
handle the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.cnsorg.org/cns-2020"&gt;CNS*2020&lt;/a&gt; conference. An
announcement will be made once a decision has been reached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="review-comments"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Review comments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This turned out a lot longer than I'd expected. As I settle down to a weekly
post, it should get shorter. However, I do see that I've got lots going on, and
perhaps I do need to be more disciplined when accepting/volunteering for tasks,
and prioritising them once I've taken them up. I'm not &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.winglemeyer.org/ramblings/2019/01/07/cookie-cleanup.html"&gt;cookie-licking&lt;/a&gt; at
the moment, so that's quite good. Still, lots to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
